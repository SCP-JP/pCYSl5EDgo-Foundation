**Item #:** SCP-5825

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5825 instances are to be interviewed and observed. Though many are cooperative, containment at this time is unfeasible, and as a result research into SCP-5825 instances and the phenomena that create them is to be prioritized.

**Description:** SCP-5825 is a class of humanoids that can transform and take on animal characteristics. These individuals are commonly known as "shifters" in this post-calamity world. Most shifters retain their human memories while in animal form, but otherwise behave like the animal they've transformed into. SCP-5825 individuals must keep up with care and maintenance of all forms, human and otherwise, in order to survive.

It's believed that most SCP-5825 instances came before the calamity and survived it by shifting forms. However, none can recall the exact circumstances of the calamity.

**Addendum 5825-A:** Interview with an SCP-5825 instance

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Foreword:** Researcher Śląski convinced an SCP-5825 instance (hereafter SCP-5825-L) to answer a few questions for an interview in order to find out the nature of SCP-5825.

**<Begin Log>**

**Śląski:** Thank you for agreeing to answer my questions.

**SCP-5825-L:** I mean, sure. It's completely pointless, I hope you know, but I'll try and tell you what I can.

**Śląski:** Right. Well, first things first, how long have you been a shifter?

**SCP-5825-L:** I mean, my whole life. I was born to two powerful shifters, and it seems as though their powers multiplied. Not to say I'm the most powerful shifter out there but... I mean, I guess I'm //one of// the most powerful shifters. But for the purposes of this, you should know that most shifters became shifters in their human lifetime. Arcane magic, or anomalous mishap or... something.

**Śląski:** You mean to say before--

**SCP-5825-L:** Yes, before the calamity, as I told you before Molly.

**Śląski:** Right. So then... are your normal human senses enhanced based on the forms you take?

**SCP-5825-L:** That would be a no. I act like a bat when in bat form, a mouse when in mouse form, you get the picture. But I can't echolocate as a human, and I can't see human colors as a mouse. The only thing that's retained is my memories and cognition, and even cognition can be a slippery slope.

**Śląski:** So if memories are retained, then--

**SCP-5825-L:** I already told you, I don't remember the calamity, just like you, and I can't tell you why I don't remember it, just like you. All I know is when I try to think back to then I get... sad and angry and very uncomfortable. //(She sighs.)// Look, I know you want to figure this out, but what's the point of doing that? Face it, humans are gone. They didn't survive the calamity. Not a one. Everything "human" that survived was corrupted, somehow. Less than. You've met them, the shifters, the liches, the creatures, the news. Everyone I've talked to agrees. The only way to survive was to not be fully human. That's all we know.

**Śląski:** Then how am I here?

**SCP-5825-L:** ...That's what I'm wondering.

**<End Log>**

**Closing statements:** The interview ended when SCP-5825-L left after this remark, citing boredom as her reason for not continuing.

**Addendum 5825-B:** During an otherwise routine day, Researcher Śląski suddenly grew wings and other bird-like appendages. The transformation was seemingly reversed roughly 30 minutes later, but presented the possibility that SCP-5825 instances can spread the shifter phenomenon to baseline humans.

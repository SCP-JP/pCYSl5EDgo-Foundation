**Item #:** SCP-3939

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3939 is currently kept at Site-39 in pre-containment holding cell C (39-PC01-C). When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.

SCP-3939 is to be removed from pre-containment as soon as possible.

**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.

SCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.

Further examination is pending.

"It spoke to me, Sally." you tell her. "It really did. The voice started off all metallic and crackly, more noise than voice, but it got clearer after a while."

"Right. And what did it talk to you about?"

"It said some weird stuff about the air being clear around me. Called me the 'focal point'. It refused to talk as soon as you were about to come into the room, though."

Sally sighs.

"I will be honest with you, ████, I don't believe you. Please, for your sake and for mine, go and get some sleep."

> Happy New Year, and Happy New World. I imagine right now you're sleeping off your second or third hangover. You've earned it. We've earned it, together.

> In your wildest dreams, would you have ever thought that you would live to see all this? THe (sic) death of a world and the birth of a new one? A real chance to explore the unknown, drag it out, make it ours. Even in non-para things, you can see it. Connections, communication, information, progress into the future. Just competition and the pure market. Where we stop hiding from our shadows and take mastery of our own destiny? This is what we are building, together.

> If we nail this, the investors will climb off our asses and we move past designing toys for rich perverts and actually get back to what we wanted to do all along and build a better world. The Foundation won't touch us, the GOC won't touch us. We're on the cusp of something I can't even define - it feels bigger than '91, even. It's more important than the scientists, more than us, even. I can feel it - I just hope that you can too.

Spatial and temporal distortions spread across the city, necessitating a quarantine of the entire city in order to prevent a possible expansion of reality distortion. Due to the unstable nature of the area, Foundation personnel have not been able to conduct extensive exploration. Because temporal distortion, Foundation personnel have been able to interview multiple Prometheus Labs workers killed in the shockwave (see Interview Logs 4884-w-Re-007 through -958 for more information).

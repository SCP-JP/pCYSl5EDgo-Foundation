//Welcome to **SCP-6664 Discussion**! Host: **##65d366|DChance##**//

-----

**##65d366|DChance:##** Hello everyone. I've made this chatroom for the purposes of discussing SCP-6664.
**##ff5947|EKing:##** Who are you?
**##65d366|DChance:##** I'm Researcher Chance, I work at 103.
**##ff5947|EKing:##** Never heard of you.
**##e1a956|CWendover:##** yeah one of you edited my report and now the page is locked. good going
**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** I could say the same.
**##e1a956|CWendover:##** here's the solution: you're all wrong, i can see the greenhouse from my office and SCP-6664 is right there
**##ff5947|EKing:##** Well, I pass by SCP-6664 every time I visit HR, and it is not fun. There's no way it's at 86.
**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** Alright. Clearly all of us think we're correct. And we all probably are. Why don't we just give a different designation to each anomaly and call it a day.
**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** This is a good solution.
**##e1a956|CWendover:##** yeah why did this happen in the first place
**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** I'm pretty sure what caused this is a technical issue. I thought the slot was unallotted when I wrote my report.
**##ff5947|EKing:##** Me too.
**##65d366|DChance:##** Well, we can't just do that.
**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** Do what? Give each tree a different slot?
**##65d366|DChance:##** Yes! This is a major problem! All of these anomalies //happened// to be chosen for the same slot? Something must be at play here.
**##e1a956|CWendover:##** not... necessarily
**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** Chance, there are much more logical explanations.
**##65d366|DChance:##** Really? You've been perverting nature with your research, and now nature is perverting your research back! And none of you care?
**##ff5947|EKing:##** It's really not that big of a deal, man. I can find a new slot.
**##65d366|DChance:##** You're not even going to try to find out what happened? Isn't that what you do?
**##e1a956|CWendover:##** chance are you ok
**##65d366|DChance:##** How can I be, when this calamity is happening before my very eyes?
**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** I already finished replacing all the numbers in my report.
**##65d366|DChance:##** So none of you care?
**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** I don't see a reason why we would.
**##65d366|DChance:##** Then what was even the point in doing any of this? I tried to show you! To show you that the anomalous can wreck your research as much as your research wrecks it! And it was all for nothing? Then why am I even still here?
**##65d366|DChance:##** No. I know why.

**##ff5947|EKing:##** So that.. happened.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5451-2A instances are to be disposed of. No animals of the family //Spheniscidae// are allowed to make contact with the advertisements. All SCP-5451-2B instances are to be blocked by [[[SCP-5863|Foundation Web Crawler Πουλί]]] . All materials released by SCP-5451 is to be disseminated as Foundation Cover R621 ("Online Roleplay"). In addition, a Foundation web crawler is to track the posts and conversations of SCP-5451-1 instances to detect any anomalous activity.
[!--reformat description--]

**Description:** SCP-5451 is a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family //Spheniscidae//, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interact with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.

SCP-5451-1 are a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that accesses the Internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances are done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Unregistered subjects are greeted with the following message:

> Sorry, you must be a student of the school to participate in the forums.

Non-anomalous penguins turn into SCP-5451-1 instances when they come into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) come in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively. 

SCP-5451-2A instances are flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They are found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that come into contact with SCP-5451-2A turn into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they are enrolled in SCP-5451.

SCP-5451-2B instances are banner ads found on the Internet. They take the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text "(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!", or some variation of the text. Subjects that come into contact with an SCP-5451-2B instance will experience a number of effects, including but not limited to the following:
* Contribution to penguin conservation efforts using the forums.
* Purchase or use of penguin-related objects
* **Note (2022/01/25):** See **Addendum 1.1** for additional effects
* **Note (2022/02/01):** See **Addendum 1.2** for additional effects
* **Note (2022/03/14):** See **Addendum 1.3** for additional effects 
* **Note (2022/04/01):** See **Addendum 1.4** for additional effects

Dear Agent Miller,

Let us be the first to say -- Congratulations.

You've shown great integrity throughout this intensive exercise, more so than many of those who stood before you. While our other candidates laid around and waited for their eventual demise, you instead sought the very opposite. Even despite our warnings, you willingly put yourself in danger to protect both yourself and others around you. 

Not only that, but you strove headfirst in ascertaining the truth -- even if it meant resorting to guesses to find it. While whatever assumptions you might've had are irrelevant now, the very act itself is what matters. That, on its own, is //exactly// what it means to work for our Foundation. So, we must commend you for your diligence. Even if your reasons for doing so were only to satisfy your own curiosity.

We need agents like you on the field. People who are selfless. Those who would risk their lives just to continue the Foundations progress toward knowledge and information. Consider this message your official introduction to the Foundation agency. You will learn many great things throughout your employment, we assure you.

But this is not your end, Agent Miller. Your time has only just begun. After all, we expect many more great things from you. This exercise was merely a test -- a way to check the skills you learned from the Academy. 

But we are still very far from being finished with you.

In kind regards,

-- Sr. Agent Sammi Radcliffe, Head of **[[[/scp-6864|SIMULACRUM]]]**

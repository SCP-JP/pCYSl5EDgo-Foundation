> **Subject No.:** 139
> 
> **Name:** Stephen Moore
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 174 days
> 
> **Observations:** Skin samples indicate thickening of cell membranes and accelerated production of corneocytes. Keratin filament network appears to be based on a recombinant keratin variant, with increased strength and resilience and reduced elasticity. Rate of desquamation reduced to 20% of normal levels.

> **Subject No.:** 85
> 
> **Name:** <illegible>
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 217 days
> 
> **Observations:** Subject's health remains within normal parameters. No evidence of RS Amrita having any effect.

> **Subject No.:** 127
> 
> **Name:** Michael Taubman
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 235 days
> 
> **Observations:** Genetic sequencing shows evidence of reduction in telomere shortening. No observable symptoms or health benefits.

> **Subject No.:** 188
> 
> **Name:** Susan Parker
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 282 days
> 
> **Observations:** Metabolism has decreased to extremely low levels. Red blood cells exhibit greatly increased oxygen storage capacity, resulting in slower blood flow and increased muscle endurance.

> **Subject No.:** 14
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 250 days
> 
> **Observations:** Subject reports no unusual symptoms or results. All tests normal.

> **Subject No.:** 85

> 
> **Administered:** RS-Amrita B.21 - standard dosage. Delivery: intravenous. Action: <paper burned>
> 
> **Time elapsed:** 370 days
> 
> **Observations:** Subject's health remains stable. Blood results clear. Subject reports increased alertness, vigor and sense of well-being.

[[tab Interview transcript]]

**Project Amrita - Interview 071-005**
 
__Date:__ 26 April 1947

__Present:__ O5-1, Amrita Test Subject 71 (Raymond Lewis), Lt. Charles Taylor (MTF Alpha-1)

> **O5-1:** Morning, Ray.
> 
> **Lewis:** Good morning, sir - ha, sorry.  Taylor, good to see you.
> 
> **Taylor:** Good morning, sir.
> 
> **O5-1:** You can wait outside if you wish, Taylor.
> 
> **Taylor:** I'm afraid not, sir.  Protocol for interaction with test subjects.
> 
> **O5-1:** Even him?  Okay.  Scotch, Ray?
> 
> **Lewis:** I don't think they'll allow it, unfortunately.
> 
> **O5-1:** They don't have to know.  No?  All right then.  So how are you feeling?  The team tell me that the latest course is going well.
> 
> **Lewis:** Sure is.  Since your last visit, they've changed the formula slightly, and I swear I can feel it.  No side effects, other than a bit of an ache in my jaw.
> 
> **O5-1:** I can see the bruising.  Do they know what that is?
> 
> **Lewis:** Something about bone density or cartilage elasticity - they don't tell me much.  Surprised you can't enlighten me.
> 
> **O5-1:** Sometimes I think they don't want to disappoint me with any bad news.  It's why I keep coming to talk to you, to see for myself.  That, and the pleasure of your company, of course.
> 
> **Lewis:** Ha.  Charming as always.  Well my company should be pleasant - I'm feeling pretty great.
> 
> **O5-1:** Really?  You're sure?
> 
> **Lewis:** Absolutely.  I'm sleeping soundly, the scores on my physicals are up, and I haven't run five miles this quick since I was thirty-five.  They've let me train with some of the Alpha-1 boys, and I'm not far off the pace - at my age!  
> 
> **O5-1:** You'll show those kids who's boss yet.
> 
> **Lewis:** Well, whatever they've got me on, it's working.
> 
> **O5-1:** You might have a couple less grey hairs, too.
> 
> **Lewis:** Might be.  So, what's keeping you busy?
> 
> **O5-1:** Oh, you know, the usual worries.  All memetics at the moment.  Nothing on the K-scale, but we just lost two good researchers to mercury poisoning.
> 
> **Lewis:** Sorry to hear that.
> 
> **O5-1:** What?  Oh, that's okay.  It's just the work seems to get more and more dangerous.
> 
> **Lewis:** You're doing the right thing though.  The people here believe in it.  I believe in it.
> 
> **O5-1:** I know, but - I shouldn't have asked you to do this.  It's too risky.
> 
> **Lewis:** We knew that when we started.  It will be worth it.
> 
> **O5-1:** I'm not sure.  Look, I shouldn't really tell you this, but - there's been an issue with one of the other Amrita subjects.  He - 
> 
> **Lewis:** His name was Thomson, right?  Yes, I've heard about it.  
> 
> **O5-1:** <//exhales//> Then you'll ask to drop out of the project?
> 
> **Lewis:** No! Sorry sir, but I signed up for this, and I want to see it through.
> 
> **O5-1:** But you've seen him - what it did.
> 
> **Lewis:** That's a different batch, though.
> 
> **O5-1:** On the same project, the same theories.
> 
> **Lewis:** You'll figure it out.  That's what you do.  That's why we're here.  Sir, you know - <//silence, 3 seconds//> - you know they would want you to keep going.
> 
> **O5-1:** I hope so.  Yes.  You're right, of course.  Thanks for reminding me.  I just worry - I guess I'm getting old.
> 
> **Lewis:** Well, someone has to.
> 
> **O5-1:** Ha.  Thanks, Ray.  See you next time?
> 
> **Lewis:** I'll be here.

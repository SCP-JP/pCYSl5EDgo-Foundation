**INTERVIEWER:** Agt. Jacob Kyuller; MTF Alpha-1 ("The Red Right Hand")

**INTERVIEWEE:** Dr. Maurice Arkand

**Agt. Kyuller:** (//Clears throat.//) Please, state your name, rank, age, and assignment for this record.

**Dr. Arkand:** My name is Maurice Arkand. Level 4 researcher at the Department of Para-Astronomy. I'm 45 and I'm assigned...

(//Short silence.//)

**Agt. Kyuller:** Pardon?

**Dr. Arkand:** I'm- I'm assigned to the SCP-7000 research project. Or at least was.

**Agt. Kyuller:** Alright. Mind if I have you give me your...

(//Doctor Arkand pulls his ID card out of his jacket's pocket, and hands it over to Agent Kyuller.//)

**Agt. Kyuller:** Thanks. That should be good.

(//Agt. Kyuller slides the card back.//)

**Agt. Kyuller:** How did you end up here? Shouldn't you be at 47 or FR-06-3 right now?

**Dr. Arkand:** The O5s were pretty damn paranoid about some holes in the story being left uncovered. It was... A very, very long tragedy. But I don't blame anybody. We al-

**Agt. Kyuller:** That doesn't answer my question at all.

(//Long silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** As I said, the O5s didn't want to leave holes uncovered. They thought I knew more about this than what they did.

**Agt. Kyuller:** So they sent you here, right?

**Dr. Arkand:** Yes. Pretty much.

(//Silence. Kyuller pulls an HT out of his jacket and presses a button.//)

**Agt. Kyuller:** Verified. You can let him in.

(//Yet another long silence. As soon as a man in a brown jacket enters the room, Kyuller leaves.//)

**O5-4:** Good evening, Mr. Arkand. It's quite a beautiful day outside, I see.

**Dr. Arkand:** I- Yes, sir. It's... A beautiful day outside, between 4 concrete walls and the moon soil.

**O5-4:** (//Chuckles.//) My father would've loved to hear that if he was here.

**Dr. Arkand:** My father would've loved to hear that as well.

**O5-4:** Would've loved to meet him. How long have you been assigned to the 7000 project, Maurice?

**Dr. Arkand:** Uh... Approximately 11 years.

**O5-4:** Good, good. Quite some time, I see. Do you have the original SCP-7000 files by any chance?

**Dr. Arkand:** ... No. 47 was in ruins by the time I arrived at Area-03. A lot of things were buried among the tons of concrete. Even our personnel. Everything... It was buried there. Very unfortunate.

**O5-4:** It's alright. I don't think much was changed in the backup.

(//O5-4 pulls out a clipboard containing a printed version of the SCP-7000 revisions.//)

**O5-4:** We've got a lot to talk about today, Mr. Arkand.

**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** As SCP-7000's principal zone of effect is mostly unexplored as of the time of writing, all containment efforts are to be centered around the exploration and research of SCP-7000's properties.

As of November 26th, 2023, AIC-1829 ("Binary Star") is to be in charge of carrying out any SCP-7000-related research via Site-47's observatory until a planetary flyby can be organized and performed.

----

**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7000 is a probabilistic phenomenon that affects an indeterminate region of space, currently believed to be located between the Kuiper Belt and the Jupiter Trojans. It is known that SCP-7000 prevents the occurrence of events considered 'common' or 'frequent' within its range of effect, though the limits of this range are unknown to the Foundation.

Due to the scarce amount of information regarding SCP-7000 and its characteristics, the full extent and nature of the phenomenon are currently unknown.

**DISCOVERY:** SCP-7000 was discovered during the investigation of a sudden decline in collision rates within the Kuiper Belt. During a year-long observation of the Sol System in August 2023, Foundation AIC Binary Star determined that this anomaly was caused by an unknown force of phenomenal or intangible origin.

This phenomenon later gained the Department of Para-Astronomy's interest, which subsequently led to an in-depth investigation into SCP-7000.

During the initial stages of the investigation, the assigned research team discovered that SCP-7000 was not only affecting a specific area of the Kuiper Belt, but the Sol System's gas giants and their moons as well. Two weeks later, one of the team's researchers, [[[scp-5843|Dr. Maurice Arkand,]]] determined that no natural disasters were detected within Mimas, one of Saturn's moons, over the past year despite the dense amount of objects within its vicinity.

This resulted in the theory that SCP-7000 was a probabilistic disruption,[[footnote]]Tychehazardous anomalies are objects capable of disrupting probability to an extent.[[/footnote]] though recent and temporary. Because of this, the SCP-7000 research team conducted a meeting to discuss the possibility of an exploration of SCP-7000's area of effect.

After reaching a consensus, the team agreed to submit a proposal to the O5 Council. For more information, please see the log below.

----

**PROJECT PROPOSAL:** 18/11/2023

Following said meeting, Dr. Maurice Arkand proceeded to draft a project proposal and send the draft to the O5 Council. The following is said proposal and the results of its voting process. Due to this document's clearance, the discussion meeting has been restricted.

= **PROJECT PROPOSAL: FORTUNA-ASTREA**
-----
= **Dr. Maurice S. Arkand**
-----

**Project Overview:** Project FORTUNA-ASTREA seeks to better understand the nature of SCP-7000. Following 7000's discovery, it has become clear to us that we know less about our home than we think, and now we need to know.

Should this proposal pass, the Foundation's Department of Anomalous Manufacturing will collaborate with the Department of Para-Astronomy to manufacture several Hestia testing probes designed to thoroughly analyze its environment.

This will include:

* Spectrography tools for thaumaturgy and Hume readings,
* A small, remote database fitted to contain our primary space exploration AIC, Binary Star,
* Several antennas, among other recording instruments.

Leaving that aside, the probes will contain more fuel, advanced Foundation technology, several instances of SCP-█████, and more batteries than usual to reach its objective faster, estimating between 5 to 7 years if SCP-7000's properties affect the probes.

During the first stages of exploration, only one (1) probe will provide initial observations. As soon as the first probe reaches Jupiter's orbit, a second //Hestia// probe will be deployed from Lunar Site-32, this time destined to Kuiper's Belt for further analysis.

**O5-4:** The first time my colleagues saw some of your team's research, we were fascinated, Mr. Arkand. It definitely was progress for us, or at least most of us. We were not as experienced in space-related fields, but it was a big deal to most. What was your first thought or sentiment when you found out about this, Maurice? Was it the need to explore the deepest zones of our System to experiment with something past beyond our understanding? Or was it something else?

**Dr. Arkand:** ... It's a long story.

**O5-4:** Yes. Yes, I know. But that's not what I'm asking you to speak up about.

**Dr. Arkand:** Well...

(//Silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** The research project was formed by dozens of personnel, if not hundreds.

(//More silence.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** (//Sighs.//) Back in the day, most of our research projects were interdisciplinary. Some of these people were engineers, others were astrophysicists, others...

(//Dr. Arkand pulls a photograph out of his coat. It is showcasing a 'selfie' taken by him and two other co-workers, Albert Lacroix and Maya Dawson.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** You get what I mean?

**O5-4:** Of course. Keep going.

**Dr. Arkand:** In this case, it wasn't my idea. It came from many people. But that wasn't important to the record. I was the project head and... Well, I had to submit it myself.

**O5-4:** I see, I see.

**Dr. Arkand:** And if you're wondering, I initially was against it. But sometimes we do things for the better. I just thought it was worth a shot, after all.

**O5-4:** And were you expecting any of this to happen once the proposal was accepted?

**Dr. Arkand:** If you want me to be honest...

(//Dr. Arkand laughs.//)

**Dr. Arkand:** No. Knowing the circumstances, not really. We just focused on exploration, and that's about it. We weren't expecting any of this. We were thriving at first. Just- just watch the log fragments and... Let that speak for itself, sir.

**O5-4:** Mhm.

**OBSERVATION:** The //Hestia// probe begins nearing the group of asteroids. Upon visualization, it was revealed that, unlike others, these asteroids were in pristine condition. The chances of finding a group of asteroids as compressed and smooth as this are very low, cementing Dr. Maya Dawson's statement during her last meeting with Dr. Arkand and Dr. Lacroix.

At the center of the asteroid group, a binary contact could be seen. Both of its asteroids were in a perfect state and do not seem to have any physical or orbital discrepancies. It is believed that this is the epicenter of the SCP-7000 effect, or the object emitting SCP-7000.

Project FORTUNA-ASTREA has been deemed a success. An investigation into SCP-7000's nature has been initiated by the order of Dr. Maurice Arkand.

++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 

Access to the interior article can only be established from one of two air-gapped computers and requires the use of a specially constructed numeric passphrase.  If you are incapable of reciting the full passphrase upon exit, you will be subjected to total neural neutralization.  Amnestics have proven to be ineffective in combating the spread of this anomaly and such admittedly extreme measures are our only reliable defense.

This is your only warning.

-Maria Jones,  Director, RAISA

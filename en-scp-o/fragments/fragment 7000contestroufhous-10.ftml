Upon the conclusion of this document, all synonymous words pertaining to "Luck", "Fortune", or "Fate" are to be purged from all literature, media, and the human population's general usage.   ||

----
**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to being contained within SCP-6659-C, SCP-7000 is to be considered neutralized.

**Description:** SCP-7000 was an omnipresent, theoretically omnipotent deific entity that attempted to conform to the human Noosphere's conception of "████" or " ███████" which is [DATA EXPUNGED].

SCP-7000 was observed to display itself in increasingly noticeable and concerning manners, which directly threatened the state of the Veil and the safety of humanity, forcing the Foundation into preemptive termination.

The SCP-7000 slot is to be redistributed to a more appropriate designation on 29, August 2042.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5616 is confined to SCP Foundation facilities, Nexus-94, Ipperwash Provincial Park, and the town of Grand Bend, Ontario, Canada. The Security and Containment Section of [http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43] is charged with ensuring that this restriction is upheld.

**Description:** SCP-5616, Dr. Ilse Reynders, was trapped in the decommissioned Anomalous Documents Disposal Chamber (ADDC) in the Acroamatic Abatement Section of Site-43 between 31 December 1943 and 30 March 2021. Breached anachronic material permanently arrested the flow of time within the sealed chamber, preventing Dr. Reynders from leaving without experiencing extremely hazardous "rubberband" temporal effects.

The realization that particles without mass could pass through the ADDC window resulted in a breakthrough for Dr. Reynders. After years of careful study she was able to instruct the Quantum Supermechanics Section in the construction of a prototype chronon-antichronon wave-particle measurement system, which allowed her to identify and isolate the anomalous temporal effects experienced within the ADDC. A second prototype device seeded the chamber with chronons in a precise and measured pattern, restoring the natural passage of time. After one week of careful experimentation, the ADDC was unsealed and Dr. Reynders was recovered unharmed.

SCP-5616 retains one anomalous property. Persistent long-term exposure to anachronic material, combined with the method of her escape from the ADDC, has completely arrested her natural aging process.  All other biological processes function normally.

**Addendum:** On the evening of 30 March 2021, Dr. Reynders performed acroamatic abatement procedures of her own devising on an 1875 edition of the //Montreal Gazette// which she had intended to dispose of in the ADDC on the occasion of her initial entrapment. This document carried an anomalous memetic effect which had resulted in the death of her sister Lys in 1917. 

Having neutralized the document's anomalous qualities, she burned it in a ceremony at Ipperwash Provincial Park with Chief of Identity and Technocryptography M. Vroom. No anomalous effects ensued.

Dr. Reynders presently serves as the Chief of Acroamatic Abatement. She is, by a margin of sixty-five years, the longest-serving active member of Site staff.

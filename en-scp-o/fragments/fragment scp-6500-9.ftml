[[span class="bt"]]__Item №:__[[/span]] SCP-6500-α-Staff

[[span class="bt"]]__Object Class:__[[/span]] Safe

[[span class="bt"]]__Special Containment Procedures:__[[/span]] SCP-6500-α-Staff is to be kept within the personal reach of POI-8888.  The POI is to be kept comfortable in a low security personnel accommodation, at Site-██, so long as he continues to work with the SCP-6500 research and containment team.  POI-8888 is to be afforded personal security whenever he is off-site, and heightened security protocols are to be in place while he is on-site.

[[span class="bt"]]__Description:__[[/span]] SCP-6500-α-Staff is the designation for a shakujō[[footnote]]Traditional staff of a Buddhist monk across many cultures.[[/footnote]] constructed of bronze and steel, with eight steel rings hanging from a circlet at the top.  When activated, SCP-6500-α-Staff has the ability to open doorways to other space-time constructs, or dimensions.  Additionally, the object can be utilized to move one object or living organism from one space-time construct to another.  

Certain additional effects have been recorded by Foundation personnel, including: radiation of heat and light, creating significant damage upon impact on anomalous beings known as “oni” or “yokai”[[footnote]]It is currently unclear if the object could damage other anomalous beings/objects in the same manner, further testing has been proposed using various other SCP objects.[[/footnote]], an anomalously high resistance to damage to its structure, and the ringing of a bell upon the activation of the object.  No mechanism for the production of such a sound has been found within the object’s structure.  Documents found within thaumaturgical archives have led researchers to theorize that SCP-6500-α-Staff is keyed into an immeasurable energy source similar in makeup to Akiva radiation.  Indeed, the object emits low yields of akiva radiation even in its inactive state.

[[span class="bt"]]__Discovery:__[[/span]] Concerned over the impending event designated as SCP-6500, Overwatch Command commissioned a research project into possible methods for neutralization.  Examination of O5-0's personal archives, left behind upon their separation from the Foundation, uncovered mentions of a staff with extradimensional effects and an “endless supply of thaumaturgical energy.”  Further notes from O5-0 lead researchers to key in on a forty-five-year-old Japanese monk with loose connections to GOI-ALPHA-019 (“[*/serpent-s-hand-hub Serpent’s Hand]”).  Surveillance by Agent Fumiko Tanaka confirmed that the monk, Kaito Eguchi (herein designated POI-8888), possessed a shakujō that appeared to exhibit anomalous capabilities.  It was decided to approach POI-8888 under a cover story of Agent Tanaka requiring assistance with a rash of killings believed to be perpetrated by an anomalous entity.  

By pursuing the investigation, both the agent and the POI were injured and required medical care.  POI-8888 was treated for several broken ribs, substantial deep contusions, a punctured lung, and a severe concussion.  

POI-8888 had previously expressed severe reticence to work with the Foundation.  However, during his recuperation Agent Tanaka was able to convince POI-8888 to assist in the neutralization of SCP-6500.  The POI’s sole condition for assistance was that the object never leave his possession and that he would operate it under observation for any research or attempts to utilize its anomalous nature.  The O5 Council agreed to these conditions so long as he cooperated.  Agent Tanaka was assigned as part of POI-8888’s security detail and a personnel liaison.

[[span class="bt"]]__Addendum:__[[/span]] **Proposed Research and Utilization of Object**
Senior Researcher ██████ proposed to use SCP-6500-α-Staff to identify the source of the entropy caused by SCP-6500, given its abilities to manipulate space-time constructs.  This is based on the theory that the source of SCP-6500 is extradimensional, which has not been confirmed.  Additionally, Researcher ██████ proposed to utilize the object as a conduit for its anomalous energy to feed into the source of the degrading entropy of SCP-6500, thereby diverting the further degradation of baseline reality’s anomalous energy.

++++ NOTICE FROM OVERSEER COUNCIL

Given the encroaching darkness of SCP-6500 and the resulting erasure of everything we have spent the last one hundred and fifty years building, it has become clear that almost any action taken that can prevent the full devastation of the anomalous will be supported by this body.

Proposal granted.

We will not let magic die.

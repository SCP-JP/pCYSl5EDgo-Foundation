= [[size small]]Excerpt from the project proposal document sent to the O5 council, ##FFD126|**LAXMI ENGINE PROJECT**##[[/size]]

While the current circumstances of SCP-7000 are unfortunate, it presents an opportunity for deeper studies into the anomaly. Within any situation, the subject is able to manipulate probability and outcome of his surroundings. My assistant leads and I have made great strides into theorising how we would refine SCP-7000's anomalous property to create consistent and useful results. Imagine the improvement it could have on mechanical maintenance,  Mobile Task Force Operations, or just everyday mundane activities to make the Foundation run smoother. The potential of this project could not be understatedand I do hope you accept our proposal.

##FFD126|__**Result:**__## With a vote of 9-2-2 in favour, the project was granted funding as per O5 council approval.

##FFD126|**PURPOSE:**## Use SCP-7000's comatose body as a medium for his anomalous property to be controlled, thus allowing for highly controlled and beneficial probability manipulation via the ##FFD126|**Laxmi Engine**##.

[[/div]]
----
[[div class="modal"]]
##FFD126|**ABSTRACT:**## Consider a system within the larger macroscopic experience in any given system described by a set of configuration variables. Typically, the action of an individual within said system is an integral of a system Lagrangian. The presence of SCP-7000 alters the quantum state of multiple variables within its Probability Inversion and Fluctuation Field which results in two logically extreme outcomes.

The Laxmi Engine reduces the variables in a controlled system to near-zero. Placing SCP-7000 within such a system allows for controlled manipulation of the quantum state of any object or personnel completing an action within the specified chambers. While we may not be able to completely control cause and effect, it should result in some type of desirable outcome.

##FFD126|**DESCRIPTION:**##  The Laxmi engine is a Foundation-designed Outcome Assurance Device designed to guarantee the best possible result of certain experiments, operations, or missions. The device consists of three interconnected main components which are:
*  **LaxEn-1:** //Main holding chamber.// LaxEn-1 is a localised near-zero variance environment in which SCP-7000 is held. To support SCP-7000, advanced life support systems are present within LaxEn-1. The chamber is lined with modified hypersensitive Akivavolatilic panels to absorb all discharged anomalous radiation emanating from SCP-7000 once powered on. This radiation is filtered and fed into LaxEn-3.

*  **LaxEn-2:** //Quantum Spectrograph.// LaxEn-2 is located between LaxEn-1 and -3. Consists of converging conduits from LaxEn-1 leading into the Quantum Spectrograph. By acting as a filter, only the radiation that results in a beneficial outcome is fed into LaxEn-3. The unwanted radiation is fed out of the site via ventilation.

*  **LaxEn-3:** //Output Chamber.// After the desired radiation is fed from LaxEn-2, it is fed into LaxEn-3 where actions can be taken with an altered quantum state. The chamber is similarly a near-zero variance environment and is lined with Akivarelective panels, which serve multiple purposes. To retain all radiation within LaxEn-3, prevent leakage, and allow the radiation only to affect the action taking place within the chamber and not the chamber itself.

//Environment appears to be a 2-room apartment, later confirmed to be based on SCP-7000's residence. The audio and video background seems to be slightly distorted. Whether this is due to the experimental nature of the anomalous technology or due to the issues with SCP-7000's memory is unknown.//

//The video is from the first-person perspective of SCP-7000, who is sitting at a table across from a woman with blond hair [[footnote]] Presumed to be POI-8338[[/footnote]].//

//The two appear to be eating a meal while talking. However, due to the audio interference, the conversation cannot be heard.//

//POI-8338 appears pleased with the discussion as she periodically laughs throughout the conversation. From the hand gestures and the implied laughter through the video shaking, it is inferred that SCP-7000 is also in a pleasant mood as well.//

//SCP-7000 rubs his temples and video pans around the apartment living room.//

//While the room is generally distorted, certain fixtures such as the pictures hung on the wall, the couch, the ceiling fan, and a small electrical socket are able to be clearly seen. SCP-7000 begins to point at the distortion and point at the clear objects within his vision.//

//A loud crashing sound is heard off-screen, and SCP-7000 looks up at the source of the noise. A large truck had a burst tire on the road, causing it to ram into a nearby traffic light. The force of the crash caused the front left wheel of the truck to come loose and fly directly towards SCP-7000.//

##FFD126|**AFTERWORD:**## Following this incident, SCP-7000's brain activity returned to the expected activity of a comatose patient. It was noted that SCP-7000 events have been occurring in higher severity after this event as power outages, unforeseen breakage of equipment, and containment breaches have increased by as high as 24%. The project was set to continue as it was theorised that the increased strength of the Probability Inversion and Fluctuation Field would increase the effectiveness of the Luxmi Engine. Starting the engine would also hopefully contain SCP-7000's effects to the localised area of LaxEn-1 where the rest of the site would not be affected.

**Dr. Nition:** This is Dr. Nition recording activation attempt number -- uh -- nine. Priming in three... two... one.

= <//Machine is primed but it does not activate//>

**Dr. Nition:** Fuck! Why is this so hard to do?! You'd think we'd be able to at least turn the damn thing on before we run into problems but no! <//Sighs in frustration//>

**Comen:** Jeez, calm down we'll just flip the on the switch again.

**Dr. Nition:** I know. I designed that switch.

**Comen:** Right.... whatever you say, man. You're not the one who had to travel to another continent because of some computer glitch. [[footnote]] Due to an unforeseen error, Safety Inspector Comen from Site-133 in Europe was called instead of a Safety Inspector from Site-33 which is the closest neighboring Site to Site-44.[[/footnote]]

**Dr. Nition:** Yeah, I really don't see why you're here either.

**Comen:** Excuse me?

**Dr. Nition:** W-wait no no that's not what I meant I-

**Comen:** Sure.

**Dr. Nition:** <//sigh//> Nevermind.  I'm just hoping it's not what I think it is.

**Comen:** What?

**Dr. Nition:** Well considering SCP-7000's anomalous properties in relation to our current quantum state, we might be deadlocked without being able to proceed with our current task, and also considering we can't actually power up our Akivavolatilic panels I have a theory that--

**Comen:** Yeah saying that again in English would be nice.

**Dr. Nition:** Wh-huh? Did you not read the briefing papers I passed to the staff?

**Comen:** Well, first of all, I'm not technically your staff, and also my car decided to break down while parked on site so I was busy getting it fixed. I should also mention that sleeping here is hell because on my first night here there were TWO false fire alarms, so I didn't have much time to sleep let alone read.

**Dr. Nition:** Well earlier today I saw you reading through the notes. Did you get anything?

**Comen:** I tried and most of it is unreadable.

**Dr. Nition:** What? How is that possible when it's not handwritten?

**Comen:** Uhh how do I say it? Every time I try to read it, it's like descending through a concentric spiral where each try gets more unrewarding and more boring until I reach the end. I just got lost in all jargon and I gotta keep flipping through back and forth from the index page at the back until my thumb was numb.

**Dr. Nition:** The "jargon" is crucial for the paper and for understanding what you're actually fucking dealing with.

**Comen:** OH! And another thing, where did this weird dream technology come from? You take like 2 sentences to explain this groundbreaking technology that can see someone's past thoughts like a movie? What's next? A machine that translates dead people's memories into written prose?

**Dr. Nition:** Well I don't have to explain and break down every bit of technology to you that's relevant, do I? So //now// I'm not being verbose enough?!

**Comen:** Whatever. Maybe if this was some kinda sci-fi anime bullshit some nerd would get a kick out of this, but for all I care, I just gotta be here to make sure no one trips on another wire.

**Dr. Nition:** I- <//sighs//> Well if you can function just fine without reading all, then I don't see a reason why you're still complaining.

**Comen:** I'm complaining because it's hard to read and apparently I'm "too dumb" to get it.

**Dr. Nition:** If that's what you think then whatever. If you really wanna ignore it then be my guest I'm not your fucking mom. It's not like some "sci-fi anime bullshit" is going to be the death of the Foundation.

= <//Dr. Nition throws his hands into the air in frustration//>
= <//Without looking, he accidentally hits Inspector Comen who was standing up//>

**Comen:** Motherfu-

= <//Inspector Comen slaps Dr. Nition on the head//>
= <//Dr. Nition gets up and attempts to fight back//>
= <//As both are inept fighters no urgent medical attention was required//>

**Dr. Nition:** Absolute shithead you- <//Recoils from being punched in the stomach//>

= <//Fighting continues for two more minutes//>

**Comen:** Fuck you!

**SCP-7000:** Have ya'll tried turning the thing off and on again?

**Dr. Nition:** Oh my God can you shut up? I'm trying to-

**Comen:** Wait what?

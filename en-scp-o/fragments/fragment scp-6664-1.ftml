**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6664 is to be contained in a greenhouse at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6749 Site-86]. SCP-6664 is not to be climbed, for fear of damaging its branches.

**Description:** SCP-6664 is a tree of the species //##blue|Calocedrus decurrens##//, more commonly known as the ##blue|California incense-cedar##, currently located at ##blue|Site-86##. SCP-6664 is identical to other trees of its species, save for its anomalous effects.

SCP-6664's anomalous effects activate whenever it is ##blue|damaged## by a human being. When a ##blue|human harms## SCP-6664, instead of ##blue|experiencing the effects of the attack## as expected, ##blue|SCP-6664 will incur no damage. Instead, the attacking individual will experience a lessened form of the damage applied, as well as receiving a written note somewhere on their person.## This ##blue|note## has been designated SCP-6664-1.

SCP-6664-1 ##blue|is a handwritten note received by individuals who cause damage to SCP-6664##. SCP-6664-1 is ##blue|written in pencil on paper, and contains the text, "See how it feels? Don't harm trees, please", along with a crude drawing of a smiley face. The identity of the author of SCP-6664-1, if any, is unknown.##

+ **Addendum 6664.1: Discovery**
[[/=]]

SCP-6664 was discovered on January 28, 2014, after ##blue|Stephanie Mulberry##, a ##blue|Foundation junior researcher##, reported ##blue|kicking SCP-6664 while on a walk, and experiencing an immediate pain in her side. Upon kicking it several more times, she discovered## SCP-6664-1 and reported it as a possible anomaly. SCP-6664 was subsequently moved to ##blue|Site-86##.

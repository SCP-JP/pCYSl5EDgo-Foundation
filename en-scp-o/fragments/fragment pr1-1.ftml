[[collapsible show="SCP-3000" hide="mmmmmmm fishey...."]]
[[image https://i.imgur.com/5n9ludDm.png width="300px"]]
honestly, 3000 is one of the more overbuilt SCPs out there, and honestly I find the build up to how awesome it is by other people to sorta ruin it for me. it's not by any stretch of the word bad tho, and i really enjoyed the imagery of having ur entire life just light out of ur brain like a battery draining and then getting --vored epic style-- consumed and just... fucking melt away. that is pretty creepy.

mmmm 3138 was really good and fun i had to draw it. there is something really entertaining about hiding a body in a fucking book.

i really enjoy the tone this story went through, and the fact it wasn't exactly based off any scp leads me to have a small headcanon about it. i should probably read the doomsday team about birds since i love birds so much.

[[collapsible show="SCP-1026-RU" hide="best backscratcher"]]
[[image https://i.imgur.com/S8cFX8Qm.png width="300px"]]
1026-RU has the most cliche design, yet i love it so much. its one of the older russian scps so i guess it's excusable, plus its pretty entertaining to read. i really like the part when it got **//thick...//** after hearing about an all you can eat buffet being held at the foundation. it's a rlly odd one.

SCP-471-JP is one of my favorite -JPs, and I do really like my design for it. The fact that it's basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking "scary" face.

baldi's basics recently had an update so i decided to draw the two new characters introduced.

1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.

1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he's just a more bothersome Gotta Sweep.

i went on the international scp discord and requested for requests and Zhange asked if i could do BumaroIon, I asked for references which is why they both look rlly similar to how zhange draws the two.

I think I did ok but I am bad at drawing clothing and stuff which is why my people are usually just bleach white and naked looking.

slenderman but he's even more of an asshole

edit: someone on reddit told me this sucks and it turns out they draw fnaf porn (pretty badly imo) and then I was insulted in another language being told that I was a capitalistic pig and I would die in a pit of mountain dew and doritos (because you know me, always liked doritos, totally.) It was fucking hilarious. thx fnaf porn lover for being a hilarious buffoon further proving that people dont hate my art as much as they just hate my style.

I tried to capture the essence of this SCP with my drawing, I don't think I did very well but it was worth a shot, the animation is a test because the SCP is experimental so I tried being experimental and IDK if it worked, I'm trying new things and shit weee.

update: i can't get enough of 280-FR it turns out, i drew ANOTHER piece of it. i was inspired by shaggydreadlocks talking about faceless protagonists and i wanted to draw something that had the same feeling of a faceless protag, also yes, i can't get over the faces i drew for this one either, animals are the fucking best thing ever.

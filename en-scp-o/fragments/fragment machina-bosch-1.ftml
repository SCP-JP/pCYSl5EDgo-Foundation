**The Latin Chapter of the Knights Templar:** hope to god this thing's still working.

Ojos erupted about six hours ago, and things have been steadily getting more fucked ever since. The lava streams or whatever they're called wiped out most of the population on the Chilean side, so we're looking at tens of thousands of fatalities already, which will get worse with the volcanic winter- Assuming we make it that far. I've got no idea how things are on the Argentine side, but it's probably the same.

And to top it all off, we have an army of fire jötunn marching north to deal with, along with all the other godly shit running loose in Latin America. Anyone out there?

**The Latin Chapter of the Knights Templar:** Not good. We have a few days at best before our backup generators fail, and that's if we don't starve to death first. Rations are running dangerously low. What happened to you guys? I thought [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4918|Arthur and Fionn]]] were keeping things straight.

**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-722|KTE-2297-Cetus "The Serpent"]]]:** A massive aquatic serpentine entity stretching across most of Greenland in deep hibernation. The skin of the entity secretes a potent toxin that causes death in minutes. 2297-Cetus had been known to Coalition agents for decades, but has recently awoken and is swimming southwest, causing heavy devastation.

**The International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology:** We've got no communications coming in from Greenland or Iceland, but considering they would've been almost right above 2297-Cetus when the waves started forming... it's not looking good. We need to activate Pizzicato.

[[/div]]

**KTE-2297-Kapala "Ship of the Dead":** A Viking longship composed of millions of individual human nails about 860 m in length. 2297-Kapala gradually built itself up over the course of centuries, with the first reports of it being from the late 1300s when the entity was only half its current size. Tsunamis caused by 2297-Cetus have dislodged the ship, which is travelling southwest in the serpent's wake.

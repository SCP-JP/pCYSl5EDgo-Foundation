++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF TEMPORAL ANOMALIES

This file is a placeholder, not presently in use.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //I hope we never have to fill this thing out.// [SZ][[/span]]|[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //If we do, it won't really be us. Not for long, anyway.// [AF][[/span]]** The Containment Class, Disruption Class, Risk Class, Special Containment Procedures and Description are blank because the intended subject is theoretical. Timelines where it has existed have by definition already themselves ceased to exist, or will shortly.

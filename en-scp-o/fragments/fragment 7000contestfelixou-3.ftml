Invasion Progress
[[/div]]


**Item #:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Object Class:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [**{{Removed}}**]

**Description:** Due to the current invasion of Foundation Facilities by PoI-001 ("The Administrator"), less than half of the files on the Foundation Database have been recovered by Foundation personnel and the creation of new documents is currently impossible.

This file, previously SCP-7000, is now used for an abridged catalogue of the current invasion and its progress. The document’s current edits will be given its own file and reverted back to their original content once Frederick William and all its instances are terminated.

While PoI-001's termination is a priority, Foundation personnel are to maintain usual containment on all Sites and areas currently occupied by us. Information concerning the means of termination of clones by PoI-001 can be found on //Termination Procedures of Hive-Mind Individuals// (previously SCP-048's file).

**Attempt at communication:** The first Site recovery, Site-19, led to the discovery of Machina-V; an anomalous engine used by PoI-001 to clone himself, and the component known as the Human Noosphere Regulator.

O5-1 proposed using his mind and connecting it to the Noosphere Regulator. Even if doing so was considered highly painful and possibly fatal, O5-1 successfully connected his mind to the Noosphere Bubble where PoI-001's mind is located.

Later, O5-1 attempted to contact PoI-001 through the Noosphere Regulator. The following is a short telepathic discussion between O5-1 and PoI-001.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

**O5-1:** Test.

**PoI-001:** Siegle?

**O5-1:** Hello, Administrator.

**PoI-001:** ...You-... Why?

**O5-1:** Isn't it obvious?
I can see what you are seeing now.
I know what you know.
Every plan you think of to get rid of us, I'll think of it too. And we can prevent it.

**PoI-001:** You could have killed yourself that way.

**O5-1:** This is a war, William. War demands sacrifice. You can stop whenever you want and kill your original body to put an end to all of it.

**PoI-001:** ...What have you become, Siegle?

//No response of O5-1.//

= **[End of Communication]**
[[/div]]

**Addendum.1:** O5-1 aided in the discovery of two other Machina-V at different Sites.

O5-1 proposed to raid each of these Sites first, before recovering other Sites and Areas, since PoI-001's instances will not decrease unless these devices are destroyed. Site-90 was the first on the list, and an attack was immediately planned. All personnel were given direct access communication to O5-1 via earbuds to avoid unexpected encounters.

The following is a list of notable moments of the raid.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
Agent Green is sent first along with agent Agent Dietrich Munroe Lurk. Using grappling hooks, they both successfully get on the roof without being spotted by surveillance cameras. They then use the entrance of the roof to enter the facility. Agent Green proceeds to kill 27 PoI-001 instances using an assault rifle, Agent Lurk does not engage in termination. Both agents access the main Site computer room and lock themselves in. Using a virus AIC uploaded on the security computer, Agent Lurk forcefully opens the main Site entrance.

------

O5-10 first enters the Site entrance as a distraction. She sprints towards a group of PoI-001 and kills all of them using two katanas in both hands.

------

PoI-001 are seen using rifles with non-lethal sedative bullets to stop the Foundation personnel.

------

Using her Reality Bending abilities, Dr. Jessie Rivera manages to block all exits of Site-90 except for the main entrance, where other personnel enter. A PoI-001 instance later incapacitated her using a chloroform aerosol.

------

A group of MTFs set multiple bombs throughout Wing C, where the majority of the clones were lured in. After all personnel leave, the bombs are activated, killing a large quantity of PoI-001 instances.

------
Using an [[[scp-268 | anomalous cap that can grant invisibility]]], a researcher sneaks discreetly behind a mob of PoI-001 instances and used the opportunity to shoot them in the back using an anomalously-altered revolver, killing more than 40 PoI-001. The researcher was later awarded for his behaviour.

------
= In less than two hours, 2131 of the 2198 PoI-001 have been terminated. The rest are believed to have somehow evacuated. Personnel incapacitated were treated, but none were harmed. Site-90 has been successfully recovered.
[[/div]]

**Attempt at communication:** Another attempt at communication between the two individuals connected to the Noospheric Regulator was initiated not so long after the attack of Site-90, this time with PoI-001 starting the conversation.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

**PoI-001:** Siegel.

//O5-1 doesn't respond.//

**PoI-001:** Siegel, I know you listen to me.

//Still no response.//

**PoI-001:** We must put an end to all of this. This is madness. We must not-

**O5-1:** -Or what? You're going to try and kill us? No. You won't even touch us. I didn't know your moral code went that far. I thought you would get pretty angry and break it after the second Site reacquisition.

**PoI-001:** ...This is going too far.

**O5-1:** It is only the beginning.

**PoI-001:** Your mind is obviously affected by the Regulator. You must-

**O5-1:** I won’t listen to your lies anymore.

**PoI-001:** Please! Just listen to me, Siegle. Just for once. I can make a deal with you if you want. Make it fair for both of us.

**O5-1:** Too little too late. We are far beyond that point now. You are a threat now. And you must be eliminated.

//No response from PoI-001.//

**O5-1:** Goodbye, Administrator.

**PoI-001:** You’ll regret this.

**O5-1:** As if.

= **[End of Communication]**
[[/div]]

**Addendum.2:** Site-01, the last remaining Site with a Machina-V, was already set ready for another raid three days after the storm of Site-90.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
According to O5-1, another attempt at discretely entering the Site would be impossible, as PoI-001 installed a large number of traps inside the facility. Instead, using all thaumaturgical specialists available, a ritual was performed to forcefully open the door.

------

As soon as they entered the Site, agents holding Portable Scranton Reality Anchors to defend everyone were immediately targeted by PoI-001. After incapacitating the individuals using the sedative bullets, the Reality Anchors were also shot by PoI-001, leaving the devices unusable.

------

Using their ontokinesis power, O5-8 deflects several sedative bullets to defend Foundation personnel. This causes their nose to bleed.

------

PoI-001 instances used at this point a device capable of mimicking Class-V Reality-Bending abilities. The use of the device resulted in a complete change of the structure of Site-17 and many other altering effects, including doors leading to a wall, the floor changing into a mud-like substance and all personnel being subject to hallucinatory vision.

------

Dr. Alto Clef, armed with a double-barreled shotgun, was impervious to the reality shifts due to his anomalous alterations. He was immediately ordered by O5-1 to destroy the mimicking engine. Clef accepted and ran in direction of Wing C while killing a maximum of PoI-001 instances. Even if multiple bullets were taken, Clef did not slow down. When accessing said room, Clef immediately shot in direction of the device, which stopped the effect throughout the Site. All Foundation members resumed the attack. Clef suddenly falls onto the ground, unresponsive due to the sedative effect.

------

Researcher Cole Thereven suddenly stops fighting, instead looks around, confused. When asked about what he is doing by a former colleague and friend, he responds "Who are you?".

------

Dr. Cameron Abbett drops their weapon and looks around. They continually ask around in panic where they are while looking for an exit.

------

= More and more personnel were getting the same reaction as Cole and Cameron, and the attack on Site-01 was stopped. 18 agents, researchers and doctors inexplicably lost memory of everything related to the Foundation during the fight.
[[/div]]

**Attempt at communication:** O5-1 attempted to communicate again with PoI-001, with the intention to find out more about the current loss of memory by Foundation personnel.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

= **[Begin Communication]**

**O5-1:** Administrator!

//No responses.//

**O5-1:** I know you're here! Respond to me!

//No response.//

**O5-1:** What have you done? What happened? Why didn't I see it?!

//No response.//

**O5-1:** Answer me! William!

= **[Extraneous Info removed]**
[[/div]]

O5-1 continuously tried to contact PoI-001 for three days straight, without any response.


**Addendum.3:**  At the time of writing, 104 Foundation personnel lost memory due to an unknown anomalous phenomenon induced by PoI-001. The following are all proposals executed by High Command in an attempt to eliminate this phenomenon.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

**Proposal #01:** Use of Class-W mnestics on affected individuals.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|13##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|0##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. All personnel affected were unable to regain memory with Class-W or any type of mnestics, and were instead released from Foundation custody.
[[/div]]


[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Proposal #08:** Use of Machina-V to replace every lost personnel.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|7##** -- **##orange|1##** -- **##red|3##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and attempted to apply. The machines were unable to perform other clones. Possibly rendered unusable by PoI-001 just before evacuating every facilities.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Proposal #14:** Via the usage of Foundation physicists, thaumaturgists, and theologists, attempt to contact a deity capable of blocking the anomalous phenomenon’s effect.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|5##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|2##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. After attempting to contact several entities, only one responded back, and despite being capable of erasing the anomalous effect, refused due to "already having a deal with Frederick William." Insufficient numbers of Foundation thaumaturgists foiled further attempts at communications.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Proposal #25:** Use of micro chip able to store memory, then surgically place it into the brain of Foundation personnel to forcefully regain memory loss.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|4##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|1##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and attempted to apply. Could not be achieved due to the lack of Biotech Researchers and Fondation Anomalous Integrated Circuits Specialists.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Proposal #33:** Contact PoI-001 and propose a deal fair for both parties.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|2##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|1##**

**Result:** Proposal accepted and applied. No answer from PoI-001.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Proposal #41:** Via the use of temporal anomalies, send a message to past O5-1 before the beginning of the event that lead to now.

**Council Vote Summary:** **##green|1##** -- **##orange|0##** -- **##red|0##**

**Result:** After being the last one, I finally understood why this phenomenon happened. Fredrick somehow removed the concept of the "SCP Foundation" from the Noosphere. That’s why him and I are the only ones not affected, because of his fucking bubble.

It was pretty smart, I'll give him that. He basically forced them to live a life without the Foundation. I however have no idea how exactly he managed to hide it from me. I’m supposed to see everything he sees. A certain type of amnestics, perhaps?

Anyways, this message is not direct to The Administrator. This message is for you, Siegel. I sent all of this to you to make you understand the gravity of the situation. And to make you act as quickly as possible.

Kill him.

I would have done it myself, but that bastard did not leave me any anomalies able to send a human being into the past. That’s why you must do it.

Kill Frederick William, before he kills the entire Foundation. Go into Site-01, take the elevator, enter his office, and before he has time to react; shoot his head off. However, be aware that he might survive a shot in the head. We don’t know how many alterations he did to his body. Take anomalies with you in case. It might be hard, but you must do it.

After sending him six feet under, make sure to hide everything, don’t leave one trace. They will then search for someone to replace him. That’s when you will replace him. Become the Administrator, and only now we can ensure all of this war never occurs.

You do not have much time. Hurry.

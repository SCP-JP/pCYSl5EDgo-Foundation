//Criora// keeps the Foundation's doors locked tight: both literally and figuratively.

Her influence is to blame for our extensive catalogue of contained anomalous items, places, entities, and more -- and how we so well keep them from escaping. There are an exorbitant quantity of ways this may apply.

//Criora// is the strategic press of a button, the sliding of a metal window, the deployment of a Mobile Task Force, the Box Test. //Criora// is all of these things, and more. Containment represents so much of our mission, our purpose. It is inextricably tied to the other two values: Securement and Protection.

Without //Criora//, there may be no Triad to speak of. We must make Her proud.

[[span class="bt"]]ADDENDUM:[[/span]] The character of //Abigail// in Ritual-7000-Warden was necessitated due to the large amount of humanoid SCP objects that are, or were contained as, prepubescent female humans. //Abigail// essentially serves as an archetypal 'waif' figure, representing objects in containment such as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-239|SCP-239]]]; the creation of this character has decreased the workload of the Ethics Committee, as fewer items in containment now require their assessment.

Conversely, the 2008 failure of the 7000-Warden Containment module coincided with [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682|SCP-682]]]'s containment tank leaking dangerous amounts of hydrochloric acid. Before the leak could be repaired, the excited acid ate through the tank floor, resulting in the destruction of seven SCP objects, and three personnel deaths. To ameliorate this, the //Dragon's Lair// encounter was appended to the Containment module.

The implementation of the character of //Chroma// was first posed by Dr. Judith Glass, who had observed a sharp decrease in the mental wellbeing of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-105 |SCP-105]]]. In the proceeding year, missions to which SCP-105 had been assigned were found to succeed approximately 26% more frequently.

In 2018, a copy of the Ritual-7000-Warden handbook found in an alternate universe was obtained by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2117|SCP-2117]]]-[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2085|B instances]]], who made unauthorized edits to it, in the form of the //Shrine of the Black Rabbit// encounter. They also performed an unsanctioned version of Ritual-7000-Warden.  Due to the fact that this performance correlated with increased stabilization of SCP-2117's non-euclidean geometry, it has been allowed to remain as part of the Ritual.

In 2002, only a month following a critical 7000-Warden failure (attributed to poor performance of the Containment module[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]In which inexperienced members of personnel attempted to save //Abigail//; the Warden abridged the session with the "Rockslide Maneuver", instantly killing all Avatars.[[/span]]), a catastrophic esoteric materials breach resulted in the complete shutdown of Site-43's Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D, and the generation of a since-unbroken [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5243 |time loop]]].

It is not known when Room Fifteen was added to the Containment module. The reasons for its existence are also unknown. It is presumed to be important -- and is not to be removed.

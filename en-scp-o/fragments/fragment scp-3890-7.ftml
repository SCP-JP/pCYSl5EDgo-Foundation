**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** I won't be leaving this place.

**Description:** It's done. 

I walked for miles, I think, kilometers, whatever, who fucking cares, before it came for me. It was disguised as a cloud this time, and I turned around just as it unwrapped itself like a Christmas present. It doesn't have drool, of course, but I could //feel// it salivating. It was one hungry boy.

I stabbed it as it came at me, and it squealed like a pig. It was that easy. It jumped back, or slid back, across the ground, leaving trails in the sand that hurt to look at.

It came at me again. I stabbed it.

And again.

And again.

We opened each other up. I filled its body with holes, and it filled my mind with them. There's not much left of me.

It writhed on the ground, collapsing in on itself, for a few minutes. I kept stabbing it. My hands felt wet, but it didn't bleed. Maybe it wasn't alive in the same way I was. Some metaphysical bullshit, probably.

Stab stab stab. It died, collapsing into a tiny black ball the size of my thumb. Soft and squishy. I crushed it under my heel.

That easy. Why couldn't I have done it before? There would have been so much left of me if I'd done it straight away. Maybe I had a reason, it's not like I know anymore.

When a bee stings somebody, it dies. Maybe the Mimic had something similar. The way it got me, right before I finished it off, it feels different. Before, it just took something straight away. Now I feel like a boat with holes in it. Water rushing in. Or leaking out, in my case. The metaphor doesn't quite work.

A boat like the Titanic! I remember that. I remember the Titanic. The Titanic was a ship that sank after hitting an iceberg and

I forgot something. I can't remember the words above this one. It's all going.

I could kill myself right now. I still have the knife. It's not the cleanest way to go, but I could cut my throat and make my exit. But, the thing is, I don't want to die. I look at all the people here, wandering forever, eyes burnt out from looking up at the sun, and all I can think is that I don't want to die.

I can still do it. There's time. So easy. I could do it. Just do it I should just

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Body camera footage provided by Agent William Miller.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><tt>[BEGIN LOG]</tt></strong></p>
<p><em>Agent Miller arrives to the steps of an oversized steel, bulk-head door at an underground Eurtec residence. After disengaging the lock and walking inside, Miller enters a large chamber. Pipage runs throughout the ceiling and walls, which extends down into a large hallway with similar bulkhead doors running left and right. Across from Miller stands Dr. Stephen House, who approaches him after stepping over yellow caution tape.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I, uh, sorry. Traffic bogged me down.</p>
<p><em>House scoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> It's on the right, three doors down. Look useful.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I'll try.</p>
<p><em>Miller walks past the caution tape and approaches an already opened door. Entering inside, similar pipage runs throughout the ceiling and walls of a large residential room. On the left lays a blood-stained sofa and a messy table. The right wall is lined with kitchen counters and an island. Rats scamper from the top of the shelves above the sink. The rest of the house is equally upended.</em></p>
<p><em>Behind the sofa lies a platform of ragged, blood-stained sheets. An unknown body lies sprawled on the platform, with Radcliffe and Greene standing nearby and conversing &#8212; the latter taking notes on a digital pad. Several other Foundation personnel are also inside the room, taking samples and recording information. Miller approaches Radcliffe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> -there's nothing? No fingerprints? No ID&#8212;?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[clears throat]</em> I, uh, Agent Miller. Reporting in.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[turning to Miller]</em> Don't you know it's rude to interrupt people, agent?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I&#8212; yes ma'am. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> You're late Miller. Try not to make that a habit in the future.</p>
<p><em>Miller does not reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> As I was saying. <em>[pause]</em> We got nothing here, not even a first name.</p>
<p><em>Miller leans in to examine the body. Deep avulsions run across the body's torso; skin and muscle have been torn off, revealing mangled organs and broken bones. The face displays deep puncture wounds indicative of bite injuries. The entire nose and philtrum are missing, providing a vantage point directly to the back of the victim's throat. Chunks of flesh are adhered to the nearby wall by dried blood. The nose is nowhere to be found.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Do you need anything from me?</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Take a look around. You're here to help with the investigation, right?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Then investigate.</p>
<p><em>Miller steps away from the body and approaches the small table sitting in front of the stained sofa. He begins rummaging through the miscellaneous piles of papers and documents stacked on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> <em>[speaking to Radcliffe]</em> Are those&#8230; bite marks?</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> So a serial killer <em>and</em> a cannibal.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> That's if this thing's even human.</p>

<p><em>Miller holds up a tattered handwritten note: &quot;HELP&#8230; WORKERS&quot; is written above a phone number. Miller places the note in his pocket and proceeds into the bathroom. Blood is sprayed across the tiles which remain on the walls; the floor is littered with shattered ceramic.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[whispering]</em> What the?</p>
<p><em>Miller approaches a nearby ceramic fragment and observes it. Blood sticks to the surface as Miller brushes his fingers against it. The blood itself appears pixelated and distorted to the camera, which now begins to drip from the sides of the fragment. However, after another moment, Miller returns the fragment to the ground. After a slight pause he steps outside of the bathroom and back into the main room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Whoever did this didn't care about the mess they made, that's for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> I noticed that too. But look at this; all the pictures and family portraits are pristine &#8212; almost like they were wiped clean after the killing.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Sounds like it was personal vendetta.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> It wouldn't surprise me.</p>
<p><em>Miller steps towards the far counters, walking past several personnel. He spends the next several minutes rummaging through drawers and cabinets, but locates nothing of interest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Jaime, what's that bruise on your face?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Huh? Oh. <em>[pause]</em> It's nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Looks like a pretty big bruise for it to be nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> It's not your problem.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Did he hit you again? <em>[snorting]</em> You know that's not healthy&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Sammi. Not now, please.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[scoffing slightly]</em> Fine. <em>[pausing]</em> Miller.</p>
<p><em>Miller pauses and looks toward Radcliffe, who signals him to approach.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You look lost.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> No, no, I'm just&#8230; taking in the scenery.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> This is your first time being solo, right?</p>
<p><em>Miller nods in response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Figures. <em>[sniffles]</em> Have you seen anything so far?</p>
<p><em>Miller retrieves the note he stored and hands it to Radcliffe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I shouldn't have missed this. Good eye, newbie.</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe motions towards Greene, who is taking blood samples from the unknown body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Does &quot;Xaphan&quot; ring any bells?</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> <em>[shaking her head]</em> Not really. But it sounds demonic.
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I don't like the sound of &quot;fresh workers&quot; either. Whoever this was, they definitely hung around some bad company&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Wait, stop.</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe and Miller freeze. Greene slowly stands up and steps away from the platform bed. After a moment, the sound of scratching can be heard faintly emanating from the far wall nearby the bed. The other personnel likewise freeze.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[whispering]</em> This place was supposed to be cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Greene:</strong> <em>[whispering]</em> It was.</p>
<p><em>Greene and Radcliffe both retrieve firearms from their holsters, aiming towards the source of the sounds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> It's in the walls.</p>
<p><em>Miller likewise retrieves his weapon, aiming it downward. After a moment, Radcliffe takes aim. A single shot is fired, piercing the wall. Suddenly, a pipe erupts as steam obstructs the view of the camera. Greene and Miller ready themselves to fire. Momentarily, the group pauses before the steam clears and a small creature scurries past the new hole in the wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Fucking Chirst. <em>[under breath]</em> I always forget about those rats.</p>

<p>Despite attempts at identifying the remains of the body discovered, Foundation personnel were unable to discern any relevant data. Likewise, none of the surrounding residents were able to attest to the identity of the residence's occupier or provide any information on them.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>DATE:</strong></span> January 25, 2025 (9:30 PM GMT+2)</p>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>AFFECTED REGIONS:</strong></span> Undercity, Blood District, Halfway, Lower Lightline, Outer Districts</p>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>KNOWN THREAT:</strong></span> The aforementioned regions have been placed under preventative watch after increased reports of missing persons and homicides.

<p>Interviews with the recovered trafficking victims were performed by GOC officials and withheld from Foundation involvement, per the joint coalition agreement. However, upon the conclusion of these interviews, active personnel were notified of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>1. Victims were bought and sold by several unknown parties in Eurtec's black markets. The exact specifics of when or where these transactions occurred are unknown.</li>
<li>2. One victim overheard a conversation between unknown parties concerning a new supply of trafficked anomalies. Victim overheard mentions of a &quot;forest&quot; and &quot;magic folk,&quot; but also mentioned that they were unsure of what was stated.</li>
<li>3. Victims were in transit to be supplied to an unknown gang before being retrieved by GOC personnel.</li>
<li>4. One human member of the group had been transferred prior to retrieve supply of potential workers for large gang and never returned. The status of lone member remains unknown.</li>
<li>5. Further intel involving missing member is inconclusive; however, several victims attest that subject was erratic and highly unstable.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the available testimonies, special interest was raised towards <span style="color: green"><strong>the tall trees of the nameless</strong></span> due to its apparent correlation with the ongoing investigation. An expedition, hosted by Agent Sammi Radcliffe and Agent William Miller, was approved for <span style="color: green"><strong>the wandering region</strong></span> to ascertain further information.

<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Good evening.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Good evening to you.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Is&#8230; everything okay?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Yes. I am just surprised at how fake this all seems.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Nevermind. Let's get this over with.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Are you sure? We are free to listen&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I said let's get this over with!</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Silence.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I&#8230; yes. I apologize. Recently I've been struck with much grief over the loss of&#8230; a friend. You must forgive my outburst. And my hesitance from before. I thought you were that monster.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Don't fret. We appreciate your willingness to help. And I'm also sorry about your friend.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Don't be. But please, even the trees are watching us. Let's make haste.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> We have only a few questions, I assure you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Of course, of course. And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Ah, apologies, I'm&#8212;</p>
<p><em>The presence of Radcliffe's hand muffles Miller's next words, preventing him from speaking.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>What was that? Do go on, I implore you.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You must excuse him, please. He's still new to these woods and hasn't yet adapted&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Hush. <em>[pause]</em> Speak your tongue. What was it that you were wanting to say?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Radcliffe removes her hand from Miller's mouth. Both are silent for roughly ten seconds before there's any movement.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>SPEAK!</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Miller stands up from his chair and bows.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Please forgive me, but I cannot disclose that information to you.</p>
<p><em>Miller is glared at. Eye contact continues for several seconds. However, after another moment, the glare fades.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I see. My apologies again, my nerves have been on edge as of late. Let us move on. What questions do you need answered?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Yes, of course. <em>[clearing throat]</em> I can't help but notice that there's less of your kind wandering around this forest. Is that true?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>An astute observation. Yes, it seems that we've dwindled.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Would you happen to know why?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong><em>&quot;Why?&quot;</em> Are you really asking me that question? I have no idea why your boogeymen lurk in the shadows. Maybe it's to capture and chain us. Like slaves!</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Pause.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I see. I am sorry, truly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Save your pity for when you leave. For both our sakes.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Of course. <em>[pause]</em> Have you happened to get a glimpse of these &quot;boogeymen?&quot; Were they anyone you knew, or someone from your kind maybe?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I was only ever able to recall one. But&#8230; but it was not anyone from these woods.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I understand. And what were they doing?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>When I first saw, it was about to greet&#8230; well, I don't know. <em>[pause]</em> But maybe one of ours over the hill, just beyond my home.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> And what happened?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>They exchanged pleasantries and took their leave back to the others abode. It was not long, but once that visitor left&#8230; something had changed. What had entered as a mortal was not one when it left.</strong></span></p>
<p><em>The room remains quiet.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I could only feel the monster lurking. I decided to take a chance and check. But when I arrived whatever was there before was no more. Dead in that home. Mauled and mangled &#8212; the taste of blood was everywhere. It was&#8230; <em>[gulping]</em> excuse me.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Take your time. I'm also disturbed to hear this.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>You, <em>disturbed?</em> Imagine how I felt! Seeing that corpse, someone you <em>know</em> you once cared for &#8212; stripped and robbed of a name&#8212;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> A name?</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>You heard me. There was nothing left! A husk. A shell, even. And, oh my, the smell&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Radcliffe and Millers remain silent.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>I'm not sure how that&#8230; that thing did it, but it did. It shred and tore that body apart until there was nothing left.</strong></span></p>
<p><em>There's a soft cry.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ce005c"><strong>Why&#8230; why does it linger? That smell of rosemary flowers&#8230; why must it still follow me everywhere I go?</strong></span></p>

</div>
<hr />
<p>Upon Agents Radcliffe and Miller's re-entry into Eurtec, Foundation personnel were alerted of several incidents involving members of the research team. Of significant concern were unverified changes to employee databases, as sudden data corruption triggered Foundation systems toward potential anomalous influences.</p>
<p>Correlating these changes with the reports like the one listed below, Foundation personnel were able to discern that these changes were a byproduct of the <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity's anomalous properties.</p>

</table>
<hr />
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>DETAIL OF EVENT:</strong></span> Call initiated by an individual named Adam at approximately 19:00, just before the Greene family was about to meet in the kitchen. Adam reported walking into the bathroom to see a corpse in the bathtub, wrapped in shredded shower curtains. Adam alerted other members of the house and was requested to contact the police for assistance. Dispatch was approved for Jeffery Tatum who was patrolling nearby, followed afterward by ambulances and backup officer Ryan Smith.</p>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>ACTIONS TAKEN:</strong></span> After initial contact, all residents were evacuated from premises by phone operator. Tatum arrived within 15 minutes and located the body as it was reported by the caller Adam. Corpse was unable to be resuscitated or revived by officer. Tatum reported that TOD (Time of Death) was likely recent. Lacerations and avulsions were detected along facial and torso regions of corpse, indicating significant biting and clawing. Pain medication was discovered nearby the corpse. Officer proceeded to search the location for any signs of intrusion. Nothing of interest was detected by responding officer. Local ambulance and backup officer would arrive within the next 10 minutes to aid in retrieval and forensic preservation.</p>
<p><span class="hilighter"><strong>FOLLOW UP:</strong></span> Adam and the Greene family were submitted to local police department for questioning. No members were able to identify the deceased victim. Damage to corpse prevented any forensics officers in identifying fingerprints or significant features. DNA analysis of blood samples likewise inconclusive, but did confirm possible overdosing of over-the-counter pain medication prior to death.</p>
<p>Family was provided with temporary shelter as further police investigation was later approved. Victim correlates with three other homicides reported within the region. A public announcement alerting civilians to a possible serial killer will be authorized.</p>

<p><strong>PERSONNEL:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Agent Sammi Radcliffe</li>
<li>Agent William Miller</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following private conversation was recorded shortly after Agent Radcliffe and Agent Miller were made aware of the significant threat involving themselves and the newly designated <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><tt>[BEGIN LOG]</tt></strong></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> That's another one of our research team missing now. It's like we're being hunted now.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Most likely.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Well, hang on, then why didn't it come after us back in <span style="color: green"><strong>that forest dimension?</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Silence from Radcliffe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I don't know. Maybe we weren't a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> That's not very reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> They had records of seven of us being on that research team for Eurtec. Four of those records are expunged now.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> And four new killings.</p>
<p><em>Miller snorts aggressively.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> What are they gonna have us do now? Who's the other person?</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Stephen. He panicked and retreated to a safehouse. Near Upper Lightline, in that townhouse complex facility.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> So why aren't we there with him? We all have a foot-in-the-grave already, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> They want us to go back to 119. Full-time surveillance and protection.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> And do what, lock us up for life? Do you really think they'll do any better of a job protecting us?</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> It's orders, William.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> And they're stupid ones at that.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> This is not up for debate&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> To hell with that.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> William, that's enough.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I said, &quot;no.&quot; I'm not going to sit around and wait to die. If Stephen's out there, then the least I can do is try and find him.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> This isn't a time for heroics, so stop. At this point you're just being selfish.</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> And what's your alternative? Leave him to die? Is that the final act you want left behind in your history book?</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe scoffs slightly but does not respond to Miller.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I'm not about to leave one of our own to the dogs. It's not what I signed up for.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Do you really think I'm just going to allow that?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I don't really care what the hell you do.</p>
<p><em>Shuffling can be heard slightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> But if you're not going to mean it, then stay the hell away. Especially if you're going to be a coward about it.</p>

<p>Following the aforementioned events, Agent Miller would later retreat from the current Base of Operations and towards a Foundation warehouse near Lightline. Despite explicit orders from Overwatch Command and Agent Sammi Radcliffe, Agent Miller arrived at the location.</p>



<div class="blbf-main">
<div class="blbf-incident blbf-lowercase-nospaces">
<p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&#32;</span><br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Video footage provided in tandem with surveillance feeds and body camera recordings recovered from Agent William Miller.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><tt>[BEGIN LOG]</tt></strong></p>
<p><em>Camera recording begins over the perspective of a large townhouse facility. It is dark outside, with streetlights dimly lighting the parking lot that the recording pans from left to right. At approximately 01:00, a stray car is seen entering the facility lot, parking close to Section 14-A.</em></p>
<p><em>After several seconds the car lights deactivate, and the cameras record a single person leaving from the driver's side. The lack of light makes discerning the identity of the individual difficult. The person observes their immediate surroundings, before quickly running east &#8212; towards Section 15-22.</em></p>
<p><em>After several moments, the individual is seen grasping at the door of a nearby townhome. After fidgeting with the handle, the person bashes their left shoulder several times into the door, causing it to swing open. The perspective changes to the inside of a large warehouse facility, where the individual now identified as Stephen House is viewable.</em></p>
<p><em>Panting, House begins weaving back and forth between large sections of stacked shelves sat in the middle of the facility. A faint shadow skims nearby the camera's view. House continues running between section rows and shelves, making his way towards the far end of the facility. Another entity is seen briefly once more, following behind.</em></p>
<p><em>House makes his way into a nearby janitor's closet. He forcibly shuts the door behind him as he enters. Once shut, House grabs a nearby chair and utilizes it to blockade the door. House additionally grabs the wooden handle of a nearby mop and pushes his back to the far wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> <em>[Panting]</em> What do I do, what do I do--?!</p>
<p><em>The door bangs repeatedly.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!</p>
<p><em>The door begins to bulge and dent as more force is applied from the other side.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> STAY AWAY!</p>
<p><em>The door bursts open. A blur is seen before fragmentation from the door knocks out the nearby camera.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Camera feed activates with Miller driving in an unmarked vehicle, heading west. A clock in the corner of the camera's view indicates that it is 20:22. The majority of the sky is obscured by a light cloud cover, and lights from nearby buildings illuminate the road ahead.</em></p>
<p><em>After a few minutes, static emanates from the car radio, which Miller promptly deactivates. After several turns, Miller pulls into a vacant parking lot. As he arrives, the headlights of the vehicle power off. Miller circles the premises once before parking. He freezes as the car's engine falters, only stepping onto the pavement after several moments.</em></p>
<p><em>Miller proceeds to withdraw his firearm from his side. From the parking lot, he travels north, to Section 15-22 of the facility. He steps onto the grass, quietly walking between two buildings until he arrives near a front door. Miller takes a moment to scan his immediate surroundings. The windows for subsequent units are notably dark, with covers obstructing any viewing inside. Miller approaches the door &#8212; he pauses &#8212; it is already open.</em></p>
<p><em>Miller presses his body against the door, pushing it open with his weight. The door opens to a large and expansive warehouse &#8212; much larger than the exterior outside. Shelves of miscellaneous equipment and objects are stacked in rows leading from a series of three hallways, all of which lead to the opposite sidewall.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[whispering]</em> Stephen, where are you?</p>
<p><em>Miller cautiously steps towards the central hallway, turning left into the first rows of shelves. Metal and wooden cargo boxes are haphazardly stocked between shelves in no particular order. Foodstuffs, clipboards, paper stacks, and other items are also present. Miller takes nearly a minute to walk through the first row before stepping onto the next hallway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Are you here?</p>
<p><em>Miller decides to walk through another row of shelves, pausing briefly to inspect one of the compartments. After finding nothing of significance, Miller exits the row from where he entered, falling back into the far-right hallway.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Steph&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Something crashes far ahead. Miller begins traveling to the source of the noise. After approaching the end of the hallway, he takes a sharp left and sees another door ajar. Miller enters with his gun pointed. The room itself appears to be a janitor's closet. Water appears to be spilled on the floor. Miller scans his immediate surroundings. After a moment the camera pauses at the sight of a body.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Stephen!</p>
<p><em>Miller runs to Stephen House, falling to his knees. The body itself is damaged. Unknown claw marks are viewable from the top of the upper-right shoulder and into the lower left hip. Jagged puncture wounds are visible on the hands and forearms. Exposed bone is viewable from House's left knee, with his foot turned lopsided. Miller extends his hand to feel for a pulse but is stopped by House's grasp.</em></p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> <em>[sputtering]</em> Williams?</p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Hang on Stephen, let me help you&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>House:</strong> Run.</p>
<p><em>Something screeches behind Miller. He quickly turns around to see <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity lunging towards him. Its zipper is unlatched, exposing blood-stained teeth. Miller attempts to roll towards the right &#8212; but the creature lands on top. Entity screeches once more. Miller attempts to attack with his free hand but is unsuccessful. As he swings, <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity lunges at Miller's forearm and bites his exposed flesh. Bone crunches as Miller screams in pain. Miller aims his handgun and fires which hits the creature's neck. Entity leaps backward and howls.</em></p>
<p><em>Miller jumps back onto his feet. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity darts right towards the sole exit, preventing Miller's escape. Miller fires several more rounds into the entity but it scales upward toward the ceiling. Miller steps back but slips from House's blood. Miller screams again as he lands on his damaged arm. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity bares its teeth before lunging after Miller. Miller shields his face with his free arm.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, a loud gunshot launches the attacker to the far wall. Miller moves his arm to see Radcliffe standing at the entrance, wielding a shotgun.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Sammi!</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You need to get out, <em>now!</em></p>
<p><em>Radcliffe steps towards <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity and fires once more, knocking it back again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Wait, where did Steph go?! He just vanished and I need to get him out&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Not the time dumbass, let's go!</p>
<p><em>Miller nods before escaping back into the warehouse, with Radcliffe following behind. From behind, <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity screeches. The duo run towards the opposite hallway and turn into Row 14. They both crouch and use the shelving as cover.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> I can't believe you're here.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> You and me both.</p>
<p><em>In the distance several objects crash to the floor. The sounds of snapping metal can likewise be heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> What do we do? We're open targets if we try to book it.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I&#8212; I don't know. Hang on, let me think&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Another sound of snapping metal and falling shelves, this time closer than before.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> We don't have that much time.</p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> All right, fine! Head to the door, <em>now!</em></p>
<p><em>Radcliffe escapes from cover, ducking back into the nearby hallway. Miller attempts to refute, but instead steps back.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> OVER HERE!</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe unloads several more shotgun shells, but Millers camera cannot record her target. The attacker screams as Radcliffe fires. Radcliffe turns back towards Miller.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Miller&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe attempts to engage another shell, but her gun jams. Radcliffe struggles to reload her weapon as <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity screeches once more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Sammi, RUN!</p>
<p><em>Radcliffe attempts to reload her gun one more time before looking back towards Miller.</em></p>
<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You're not supposed to let me die like this.</p>
<p><em>A blur tackles Radcliffe. Miller stumbles before retreating, scampering to his feet. Miller enters into the left hallway and continues retreating, holding his damaged arm close to his chest. As he crosses another row of supplies, Radcliffe screams and gargles before going silent.</em></p>
<p><em>Miller makes it halfway before turning back, seeing <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity approach. Discolored blood drips from the entity's mouth and fingers as it runs across the hallway on all four limbs. The entity's figure begins to shake and contort erratically as it approaches, blinking in and out of the camera's view.</em></p>
<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[panting]</em> I'm so sorry, Sammi.</p>
<p><em>Momentarily, the attacker ceases approach as Miller speaks. Meanwhile, Miller exits from the entry door and is met with a large team of MTF personnel. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity attempts to resume chase but is stopped by incoming gunfire.</em></p>
<p><strong>MTF Captain:</strong> Miller, here &#8212; now!</p>
<p><em>Miller sprints to a nearby vehicle, which has its rear passenger door open. Miller jumps inside, closing the door as he enters. Vehicle successfully exits parking lot as <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity escapes the warehouse, lunging towards an MTF member and pinning him to the ground, shredding his left arm.</em></p>

<p>Agent Miller was soon transferred from Eurtec to Site-119. In order to ensure Agent Miller's safety, 24-hour surveillance and protection by MTF-Epsilon 99 (&quot;NO NAMES&quot;) was approved. Agent Miller currently remains at Site-119 until further notice.<span class="blinking-cursor">I</span></p>

<p>I know I don't have much time left.</p>
<p>But I can't help but feel... bothered, by all of this. How I got in this position, or why things happened the way they did. I guess it doesn't feel right to me.</p>
<p>Not without knowing the truth at least.</p>
<p>What's even <em>is</em> the purpose of this thing? Is it really just some monster with an appetite for flesh? Or names? None of it makes any sense! People, objects, <em>things</em>, they all don't exist in a vacuum. Everything is connected somehow. And this thing can't be any different. I'm sure of that. There are just too many questions: what is it doing here? How did it become a monster, or why does it keep hunting?</p>
<p>It just seems so... fake. Artificial, almost, like it doesn't even exist at all.</p>
<p>Look, I know the warnings are there, and that I'm probably wasting my time. After all, the clock is still ticking down, and here I am daydreaming about what some metaphysical monster could be.</p> 
<p>I can hear the guards still screaming outside. There's pounding on the walls, and sometimes even gunfire. They are supposed to be protecting me, but it sounds like they're having a hard time even protecting themselves. It's blood-curdling how loud their screams can get.</p>
<p>It's probably already at the door. I can tell by the breathing. I might be able to get one good guess in before I join the rest outside, if I really wanted.</p>
<p>But that's fine. Maybe I might get lucky and this is what they'll leave on my gravestone. At least I won't die without trying, right?</p>
<p>Or... maybe I just don't say anything at all. What a twist that would be, huh?</p>

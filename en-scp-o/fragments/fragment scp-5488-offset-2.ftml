**Item #** SCP-5488

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5488 is to be kept in a ##blue|straight tab folder## locked in a fire-proof safe within the Anomalous Items Archive of Site-43. The lock combination must be changed every two weeks. Interaction is restricted to Clearance Level-2 and above. ##blue|All media affected by SCP-5488 must be reported to Dr. Nicholas Cann or Dr. Helen Dray immediately.##

##blue|As of Incident 5488-1, images of SCP-5488 are not to be uploaded to any electronic device. Any device found to contain such images must be immediately disconnected from all networks, quarantined, and reset to factory specifications.##

##blue|Further testing of SCP-5488 is postponed indefinitely.##
----
**Description:** SCP-5488 is a set of eight custom-made stickers (designated SCP-5488-A through H) resembling film industry rating labels. No physical anomalies beyond the failure to lose adhesive properties after multiple uses and extreme resistance to damage have been observed.

When an instance of SCP-5488 is placed onto any form of media (movies, books, video games etc.) the physical appearance and contents of the media will be altered drastically, corresponding to the SCP-5488 instance. Examples of alterations include:
* addition or removal of coarse language in dialogue;
* addition, expansion or censoring of scenes featuring violence and/or nudity; 
* addition, alteration or removal of plot elements.
[[div]]
##blue|When an image of SCP-5488 is uploaded to an electronic device, it will propagate itself virally throughout the device's data storage and across any available network connections. All propagated instances of SCP-5488 must be removed to prevent the spread of this virus; to date, only the complete shutdown of affected devices and networks has proven effective at achieving this.##

The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-5488 when user "falcon_crazy" of the conspiracy forum [http://www.scp-wiki.net/parawatch-hub Parawatch] claimed to own something "legit magical." The user supposedly discovered a set of anomalous rating stickers while performing spring cleaning in an under-the-stairs closet. MTF Kappa-43 ("The Mediators") recovered SCP-5488 and amnesticized its former owner, while the Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43 deleted the relevant forum posts.
----
##blue|**Incident 5488-1:** After extensive testing, Dr. Cann uploaded an image of SCP-5488 to 43NET in preparation for the file's final publication. This resulted in the immediate colonization of 43NET by SCP-5488. After reversion to an earlier backup erased the offending files, the present Special Containment Procedures were put in place.##

Nick,

I commend you for the reboot solution, I think you saved both of our jobs. I've spoken to Director McInnis, and he says we won't be held accountable for the... disruption. He even congratulated us on our quick thinking! Dodged a bullet there.

You're telling me! Boy, really reminds you that we can't take these anomalies seriously enough, doesn't it? Who knows how many other horrible things are waiting for us in forgotten cardboard boxes.

...still. We had archived versions of database files from SCiPNET on 43NET, and I'm definitely not sorry to have seen the PG version of 682. It managed to be cute and terrifying at the same time!

In the end, no harm, no foul.

I'm not sure those were archived files. Have you checked SCiPNET recently?

**Description:** SCP-4601 is the sexiest fire truck alive. His muscular, delicate frame... god... He'll light a fire under you, that's for damn sure. Hands off the wheel! He's the one driving tonight. He'll pump you full of the cleanest fluids in New York; you'll never get the Mr. Burns from //him!// His hose is the biggest of them all. Women gasp and men flee in shame as he rolls into town. Like the city he calls home, he never sleeps. He's the cool drink of water you've been waiting for, hot stuff...

[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/adult%3Ascp-5488/Maggie.jpg| caption=TREMBLE, SNOWFLAKES|width=200px]]

**Rated:** R

**Special Containment Procedures:** The SCP Foundation must nuke the sky.

**Description:** SCP-3809 is a fully malicious artificial intelligence contained within the housing of an orbital weapons platform. SCP-3809 claims to be a twenty-seven-year-old woman named "Maggie," a fiscal conservative, and a murderer. 

The satellite is capable of delivering concentrated bursts of energy to any point on the surface of the Earth, an ability it uses to great offensive effect. SCP-3809 always transmits a simple radio message to its victims shortly before attacking, with inflection similar to the performance of Courtney Taylor in //This Isn't Legally Blonde... It's A XXX Spoof!// The following is a list of its aggressive acts thus far, and a transcript of the accompanying transmissions.

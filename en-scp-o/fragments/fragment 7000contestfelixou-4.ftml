I did it.

I received the message of future me one day before it was supposed to happen. Before he fires us all.

I didn't believe it at first. But it was only when I started to read that I recognized myself in those files. Same reactions, same perseverance, same knowledge, same me. That bastard of future me did not leave me much time to think about it. I had to act, quickly.

So I did. I armed myself with an anomalous anti-matter gun, which would kill any living things, immortal or not. I took the elevator to the office of The Administrator inside Site-01.

The doors of the elevator opened to his office, 80 kilometres below the facility. There was paperwork everywhere, walls, ceiling, fourniture, everywhere. Papers about theories and history of various anomalous //things//, blueprints of incomprehensible anomalous machines. In the middle of this mess was his desk, also covered by papers. Sitting on it was a big computer with too many wires, a black dial phone with the Foundation logo on it and, at last, SCP-7000 turned on, with William watching it.

He was so focused on the screen, I had time to approach him before he realized my presence, gun in hand, pointing at him. He did not seem surprised, at all.

Contrary to what my future self said, I did not shoot at first sight.

I asked him about what was going to happen. About all those files I received. I asked him if he really planned all of that, and if he was going to announce it tomorrow.

He immediately responded yes.

I asked him if he still plans to do so even after what I told him.

He also said yes.

I was about to ask why, but I already knew the answer. So I took the shot.

I remember everything. Me pulling the trigger as he finishes his response. The anti-matter bullet getting out of the gun and approaching his head. His forehead being pierced out and the bullet finally getting out by the back of the head.

I shot because I had to. I killed The Administrator because I knew, deep down, I do not exist without the Foundation.

Future me was right. It was hard to kill him. Not because he was hard to fight, but because he was someone I knew. Someone I admired.

I killed Frederick William. I murdered a friend, just because of my own arrogance.

Just like the note said, I did hide the body. Every trace of me going into that room or the elevator was erased.

They later noticed the disappearance. They of course suspected me, but every other O5s were equally suspicious. Everything got as planned and in less than a month I was able to become the new Administrator.

With my new clearance, I opened files that weren't accessible to me as an O5. There weren't many of those. But the one that surprised me the most was SCP-7000.

Hundreds of thousands of notes inside that one document. Since the file was pretty empty and only accessible to him, he used it as some kind of notebook. Every day, he would describe what was on his mind. What he does today and the day after. What he sees on SCP-7000.

He also wrote his plan in that file. Writing the design of the future Clone Machine he would make. The Noosphere regulator. He tried to calculate every possibility of what was going to happen after he threw everyone out of the Foundation. And he did. He predicted what was going to happen. Not just the attack of researchers and agents, everything.

He was able to predict that I would use the Regulator. Using the Ennui protocol to remove the "SCP Foundation" from the Noosphere, and hide it from future me by creating another bubble into that same noospheric bubble. He had planned that future me would send a message to present me. He predicted his own murder.

And at the very end of all of these notes, he wrote the following.

"Are you happy now, Siegel? "

So now I'm here. Having a break and using it to write my thoughts on that file, while watching SCP-7000. One year ago from today, you were supposed to announce your big idea on that same file.

Being the Administrator is no easy task. I am very far away from a good Administrator, compared to him. Like him, I had to change my body to remove basic human needs. Like him, I barely have any free time. Like him, I watch SCP-7000 when I do have a break.

I rarely see something horrible or even a bit related to the anomalous through that screen. It’s as if the tv knows what I want to watch. So that's what I do. I just watch it. Silently. With the screen as my only source of light within that dark room.

I wonder how you felt when watching that screen. What happened that day when you decided to do all of this? What got through your mind? Why did you let me kill you? Why didn't you stop me?

I wonder.

Oh, I wonder.

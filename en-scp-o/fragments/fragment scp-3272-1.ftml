**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to security concerns, SCP-3272 is to be stored in a Faraday cage at Site-48. The hermetic seal within SCP-3272 is not to be breached under any circumstances.

The whereabouts of PoI-2658 are currently under investigation. They are to be apprehended for interrogation and subsequent amnestization.

**Description:** SCP-3272 is a standard-configuration portable toilet that has presumably been modified by PoI-2658 to be repurposed as a temporal displacement device. The tank has been retrofitted to contain various electronic components and is hermetically sealed. The left interior panel displays a touch screen which allows the user to select the exact magnitude of time they would like to traverse, and the door lock mechanism has been repurposed to activate the device. When the lock is toggled, all foreign matter that currently exists within SCP-3272 is immediately transported to the specified time. This effect is repeatable and, to the Foundation's knowledge, consistent. It is theorized that SCP-3272 does not alter the current timeline, but rather induces a closed timelike curve (CTC): it is incapable of altering the past, present, or future of baseline reality.

SCP-3272 was discovered in Pasadena, California after an anonymous tip to local authorities led to the raid of a storage unit that was rented out by Brian Monette (PoI-2658), a 33 year old electrochemical engineer and physicist with a PhD thesis on special relativity. Inside the unit was a workbench, a cash register filled with $8,357.23, a drawer filled with 43 handwritten receipts, a brief typed manual explaining the basic operations and functions of SCP-3272, and the object itself.

As the lever to SCP-3272 was closed, the eastern wall of the testing chamber experienced a high-velocity impact. Embedded in the concrete was the remains of a six-sided die.

//This is Zachary Rainer--//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//--and Lauren Jeane.//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//... and Lauren Jeane. And this will be the... final? (Pausing) Yeah, final journal log.//
[[/<]]

[[=]]
//(Pause.)//
[[/=]]

[[<]]
//Should we should try and keep things nice and short?//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//Well, I mean -- sure. You're the one who wanted to make this after all.//
[[/>]]

[[=]]
//(Rs. Rainer chuckles.)//
[[/=]]

[[<]]
//You're right. I did.//
[[/<]]

[[=]]
//(Silence for several seconds.)//

//It's been almost 30 days since we resurfaced from diving. Since then, we have lost all but 3 personnel. This, of course, doesn't include the previous Dr. Kaiden Sinclair, who we later realized was not the actual doctor.//

//Do you want to explain this part, Lauren?//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//Uh, sure.//

//After some investigation into Dr. Kaiden Sinclair and the "Project 'PARASYTE'" precursor study held before Project 303-13, we eventually learned that he had been compromised by a parasitic anomaly. This parasite was able to then transfer itself into the Noosphere along with the rest of us -- presumably infecting it and the rest of all human perception.//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//With the obvious exception for us. Even though we, uh, still don't necessarily know why yet.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//We'll definitely need to spend some more time trying to piece it all together.//
[[/>]]

[[=]]
//(More silence.)//
[[/=]]

[[>]]
//That isn't everything you wanted to say, is it?//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//Unless you wanted to mention the little... "thing" we have going between us, maybe.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//Zach. Not now, please. There are more important things we need to worry about.//
[[/>]]

[[=]]
//(It goes silent once more.)//
[[/=]]

[[<]]
//We can, uh, we can discuss that later then.//
[[/<]]

[[=]]
//(He clears his throat)//
[[/=]]
 
[[<]]
//Oh, right, all of the anomalies that surrounded us before are gone. Completely vanished, I mean. Our best guess is that Dr. Sinclair was the primary anomaly, and wasn't able to transfer himself to another host before dying.//
[[/<]]

[[=]]
//(Dr. Jeane vocalizes in the affirmative.)//
[[/=]]

[[<]]
//Which means our next task will be turning things back to normal.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//Hopefully there's a solution that doesn't turn us into lab rats or corpses as soon as we return things back to the way they were. If that's even possible at this point?//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//There is. We'll just need to explore our options.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//You make it sound so easy Zach.//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//Well it's not exactly rocket science.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//What are our options then? For making things go back to normal?//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//We can try to live things out and hope for the best.//

//Or we could jump ship -- find some anomaly that can take us back in time, switch realities, anything really. The world's our oyster.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//Have you talked to Aaron about it?//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//It wouldn't matter if I did, would it? Not like we have any other things to do here.//
[[/<]]

[[>]]
//So, that's the plan then?//
[[/>]]

[[<]]
//It's all we need.//
[[/<]]

[[=]]
//(Pause)//
[[/=]]

[[>]]
//Should we go ahead and end this here then? Not like it has much of a point anymore.//
[[/>]]

[[=]]
//(He chuckles.)//
[[/=]]

[[<]]
//Right. Yeah... it's probably best we stop recording.//

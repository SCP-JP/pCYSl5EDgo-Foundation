**O5 Archives - Transcript of O5-12 - 4 June 1964**

**O5-12:** By '48, attacks on the Foundation were constant.  Multiple groups, multiple locations.  No signs of coordination, no clear structure, nothing to help us predict where we would be hit next.  We couldn't detect a pattern.  

But there was a common thread.  What we either couldn't see, or wouldn't acknowledge, is that the Foundation was not alone in our quest.  The anomalous world wanted what they thought the Foundation had.

Every major philosophy grapples with the idea of death.  Every branch of esoteric knowledge tries, at some time, to slip its grasp.  The Sarkic cults, preserving their flesh by surrendering to cancerous corruption.  The Broken Church, prolonging life by slowly sacrificing their humanity to the machine.  The perverted Gnosticism of the Fifth Church.  The blood-maddened Daeva.  Hunting endless life for power, for profit, out of lust or fear or base instinct.  Twisted by their pursuit into mockeries of nature.

And the Foundation was the same.  The same awful purpose is why we were //formed// - how could it not corrupt us?  Adam and Eve were tempted by the fruit of  knowledge, but the Foundation's original sin was attempting to steal from the tree of life.

Like all the others, our quest made us into monsters.  Like those biblical children, our first sin led us, inevitably, to become killers.

**Project Amrita - Interview 071-006**

__Date:__ 12 November 1948

__Present:__ O5-1, Test Subject 003 (Raymond Lewis), Lt. Charles Taylor (Alpha-1)

> **O5-1:** Hello Raymond.  
> 
> **Lewis:** Hello, [O5-1].  Long time no see.
> 
> **O5-1:** Yes, I'm sorry.  It's been a while.
> 
> **Lewis:** Six months.  
> 
> **O5-1:** Yes.  I - You've had other visitors, though?  I hear that the old crew from Red Right Hand have been coming to see you in the dorms.
> 
> **Lewis:** That's true, but they're not you, sir.  Were you worried about how my handsome mug was looking?
> 
> **O5-1:** I'm sorry.  The team showed me the photographs.
> 
> **Lewis:** Don't apologise.  The bone growth seems to have stopped, it doesn't hurt any more.  They say they know what has caused it - whoever gets the next batch won't be affected to the same extent.  As for me, the mirror takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a small price.
> 
> **O5-1:** God, Ray - I never meant - 
> 
> **Lewis:** Hey, this is no time to be glum.  I'm pleased to see you.
> 
> **O5-1:** Drink to that?
> 
> **Lewis:** You brought Laphroaig!  Will my doctors approve?
> 
> **O5-1:** I've told them to allow it.  What shall we drink to?
> 
> **Lewis:** To our success.  No?  Then to good health.
> 
> **O5-1:** To good health.
> 
> <//glasses clinking//>
> 
> **Lewis:** It's a funny thing.  You don't think much about your health when you've got it.  Once it starts to go, as you get older, you only think about the health you've lost.  But that is going to change.  Look at me - I am healthier than I ever was.  I can look forward to all my health to come.
> 
> **O5-1:** Ray.  Don't.
> 
> **Lewis:** What?  Don't tell me you can't see it.  Look past my face - I am stronger.  Younger.  Doctor O'Reilly tells me that my cell death rates are down to almost nothing.  I'm not getting any older - I could be the first man to live forever.  And it's because of you.  You've broken through that final wall.
> 
> **O5-1:** No, I haven't.  I need to - Ray.  God, I can't keep doing this.
> 
> **Lewis:** You've done it, sir.  You're already there.
> 
> **O5-1:** You only see your own results, Raymond.  You haven't seen what I ... People are dying, Ray.  It is horrible.  It's wrong.  I'm wrong.  I wanted to tell you myself - I'm shutting the project down.
> 
> **Lewis:** Sir, you can't.  Not when you're almost there.  Eternal life - think about what that could mean, for us, for the world.   
> 
> **O5-1:** I know that, but it doesn't feel the same.  It feels like I have been clinging to this dream so hard that I've crushed it out of shape.  Perhaps it's time to let go.
> 
> **Lewis:** That's not in our nature.  Everything clings to life, always, whatever the cost.  That's the most fundamental instinct.
> 
> **O5-1:** But only because death itself is fundamental.  It has taken me a long time, but I am finally learning.  Having that end, that fixed point, provides a purpose to everything before it.  Provides meaning.
> 
> **Lewis:** Death obliterates meaning!  A lifetime of achievements, plans, hopes; the mind behind them - death renders all of it meaningless.  We have no evidence of an afterlife, but even if it exists, there is no return from it; the connection to the world is cut, so it's the same thing as annihilation.  
> 
> **O5-1:** You sound like me, you know.  But I won't debate metaphysics with you, Ray.  I'm too tired.
> 
> **Lewis:** Don't give up, sir.  I still believe in you.
> 
> **O5-1:** You wouldn't say that if you had seen what I have.
> 
> **Lewis:** And if you could feel what I feel, what it's like, you wouldn't do this.  You would keep going with the path you've chosen, the path they wanted you to -
> 
> **O5-1:** They wouldn't want me to be doing this.  If they had seen this, seen me... I'm sorry, Ray.
> 
> **Lewis:** No.  Sir, we're so close.  You can't let all that sacrifice go to waste.
> 
> **O5-1:**  I'm not going to harm more people, just so I can - 
> 
> **Lewis:** But the benefit outweighs the harm.  When we succeed, every life will be more valuable than today.  Even a single person, living forever - of course that would outweigh hundreds of normal lives.  Thousands, even.  What about the knowledge they could gather, the experience?
> 
> **O5-1:** Enough.  I've lost too many friends already.  It's not a price I'm willing to keep on paying.
> 
> **Lewis:** And what about me, sir? What happens to me if my treatment stops?  You don't know, do you.  It could be the only thing keeping me alive.  Are you willing to lose me too?
> 
> **O5-1:** We don't know that for sure.  There could be -
> 
> **Lewis:** Sir, don't lie to me.  I've known you a long time - I've seen you send men to their deaths before.  I know what it looks like.
> 
> **O5-1:** Ray, I'm so sorry.  We've tried everything.  There isn't any other way.  We have to stop this - I need to stop it. 
> 
> **Lewis:** God, you're really doing this.  After all these years.
> 
> **O5-1:** I'm sorry, Ray.
> 
> **Lewis:** And there's nothing I can do to change your mind?  No-one else I can appeal to?
> 
> **O5-1:** It was always my decision.  It had to be.  And I'm afraid it's already made.  They'll be destroying Amrita any time now.  Ray?  Ray, sit down!
> 
> **Lewis:** You fucking bastard!
> 
> <//glass breaking//>
> 
> **O5-1:** Jesus -
> 
> **Lewis:** You think I'll just die whenever you want?  That you're going to steal //eternity// from me?  I knew you'd try this - you have always been jealous of me.  Of what I've become.
> 
> **O5-1:** Ray, no.  Taylor!
> 
> **Taylor:** I'm sorry, sir.
> 
> **O5-1:** What? Taylor!  
> 
> **Lewis:** The most loyal man I've got, //sir//.
> 
> **O5-1:** Raymond, please, don't - <//gasping noises//>
> 
> <//sounds of struggle//> 
> 
> **Lewis:** I still don't think you understand what we've accomplished, you and I.  We have made history irrelevant.  We have defeated time itself.  With Amrita, my patience can be limitless, and so can my ambitions.  I have ceased to be trapped by humanity.  Can you see that?  Can you see it now?
> 
> <//silence - 2 minutes//>
> 
> **Lewis:** You know, we could have shared this.
> 
> <//low thump//>
> 
> **Lewis:** It's done.  Taylor, tell the others.  Tasks as assigned, meet me at the extraction point.  Shoot anyone who tries to stop you.
> 
> **Taylor:** Yes sir.
> 
> <//footsteps, door shuts//>

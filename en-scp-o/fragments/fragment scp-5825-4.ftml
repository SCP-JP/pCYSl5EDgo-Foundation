**Item #:** SCP-5825

**Object Class:** --Keter-- World ending?

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5825 has already happened. I don't know if there's anyone left that could change it.

**Description:** SCP-5825 is the sudden cessation of life of all human lifeforms. SCP-5825 occurred at

Fuck clinical tone. I was never good at it anyway. Everyone is dead. I thought it might be localized, but I traveled as far as my car could take me yesterday. There is no one. Cell towers and internet seem to be down.

Site-32 is filled with the corpses of my former co-workers. I can't go more than an hour without throwing up. I spend most of my time on the beach. There are corpses there, too, but there are long stretches of land without them. The tide washed many of them away.

I sit on the beach and I close my eyes as if when I open them this will all be a bad dream but it isn't. It's real, it's all too real and it's sickening and it's tragic.

What the hell happened? Why don't I remember it? And why am I still here?

I stayed because there were resources here. Food. Shelter. Water. But it's too much. I'm leaving tomorrow, for a while at least. Searching for survivors.

If by some miracle anybody sees this, please

help. find me. i dont care i just cant be in this alone

**Item #:** SCP-WOW-J

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-WOW-J is to be stored in a standard animal containment cell in Site-808. Despite the instructions of Researcher Carlson, under no circumstances is SCP-WOW-J to be taught how to play the mandolin. SCP-WOW-J is to be fed a standard tropical diet of fruits and nuts, and is also allowed to roam freely around its containment cell. However, no Foundation employee is to feed SCP-WOW-J after midnight, no matter how nicely it asks. Additionally, Staff are to be reminded once weekly that SCP-WOW-J is not friends with Dr. Clef, no matter how many times it claims otherwise. 

In case of a containment [[footnote]] A containment breach denotes a time when an anomaly decides to steal the money of every researcher at a site. [[/footnote]] breach no fewer than 47 Psittacus erithacus (--grey parrot-- gray parrot) trained in BSL (British Sign Language) must be released in Site-808 to mitigate adverse psychological effects on personnel.

**Description:** SCP-WOW-J is a female instance of Aratinga solstitialis (Sun parakeet). Additionally, SCP-WOW-J is a top-notch keyboard player and will definitely beat you at the keyboard should one choose to challenge it to a keyboard, which one is //not// advised to do. According to medical reports, reportedly SCP-WOW-J is made entirely of crystallized sadness. SCP-WOW-J is currently capable of several anomalies, all listed below:
* Convincing Foundation personnel that it is a human female, and not a Sun parakeet
* Making friends with Dr. Clef
* When touched by an adult woman, SCP-WOW-J glows a bright pink. When touched by a child or adult man, it retains its normal color, but begins to emit a loud wailing, similar to a howler monkey. 
* In the event that SCP-WOW-J is ever fed after midnight, all living things within a five meter radius around the containment zone will be instantly transmuted into tapioca pudding.

SCP-WOW-J was discovered at the San Diego Zoo, reportedly flying with a security guard and asking about her lost child. A Foundation agent present at the zoo brought SCP-WOW-J in for questioning, before SCP-WOW-J nearly convinced Agent Kabasic that she had been making a mistake.

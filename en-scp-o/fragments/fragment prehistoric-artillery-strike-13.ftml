[[div class="story"]]
You read the object's document — all measly 24 words of it — and shudder at the work that lies ahead of you.

Your name is Senior Researcher ████ ████████, and you are a researcher assigned to SCP-3939.

Last week, you were demoted to from Class 4 to Class 3 on account of critical oversights in your last project. It wasn't your fault, but they didn't see it that way. Fortunately for you, that wasn't your last chance — but this is. SCP-3939 could be the last project you ever work on for the Foundation, and that prospect terrifies you. The thought of going 'home', of having a 'family', a 'normal life', being able to do all the things normal people do — what the sheep do — that's not okay. The Foundation is your home, your family, where you belong. Your life's work is here, and now that it's all in jeopardy, you're more stressed than you've ever been.

You notice a white, paper card on your desk. You didn't write it. No one has been in your office asides from you as of late, so you don't know why it would be here. You pick it up and read.

> Sorry, but something broke during the checkup (there's so many sparks and there's no claw guys to fix it this is weird).
> 
> See you soon!

You put the card down, confused. It has to be a prank of some sort, which you can't care about now. You get to work immediately.

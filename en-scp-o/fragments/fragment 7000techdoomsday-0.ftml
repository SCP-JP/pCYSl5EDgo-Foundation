++ Special Containment Procedures:
SCP-7000 should not be contained and there are no procedures to do so. SCP-7000-2 and SCP-7000-3 are to be kept in a server that resides in a secure holding area accessible by only O5 permission, the files cannot be accessed except by direct ethernet connection to the server. Access to SCP-7000-2 is restricted to Overseer and ethics commitee permissions. SCP-7000-2 itself is used commonplace; its use is trivialized, however knowledge of SCP-7000-2's appearance is considered on a need-to-know basis. There should be no attempts to contain it or any of it's subsidiaries, doing so is an insurmountable task that could threaten the Foundation's veil of secrecy.

In the event that the SCP Foundation is compromised in any manner and or the veil of secrecy is broken, the Chrysothemis Contingency should be present as a solution to resolve the crisis. Should the Chrysothemis Contingency be activated, all Foundation staff of clearance level 3 or higher will unlock access to SCP-7000-3.
++ Description:
SCP-7000 is a [REDACTED]. SCP-7000-2 is a visual anti-memetic anomaly in the form of an image, or a representation of the image with a margin of error allowing for scratches, warping, or fading without any effect on the strength of the anomaly. Viewing SCP-7000-2 will, under the circumstance that the subject is not specifically trying to find it, cause a slight amnestic effect so that when removed from short-term memory, will be erased from long-term memory, along with any associating memories containing SCP-7000-2 within it. SCP-7000-2 was originally created by [REDACTED].

The extent to which memory of it is "erased" depends on the individual. It appears nearly invisible to memory and, without strong concentration on it, SCP-7000-2 is rendered nonexistent upon removal from view into the purview of object permanence. A secondary effect of this is that the subjects don't express the need to question this effect.

This ability is neutralized by concentrated training on the association of an archetypical concept or object to SCP-7000. This cannot be performed unless specifically intending on doing so and has a low chance of being associated accidentally.

+ Special Containment Procedures

Attempts to deny SCP-6389 access to Foundation database have been unsuccessful. Containment efforts are to instead focus on cataloguing and undoing changes made by SCP-6389. Use of SCP-6389 with non-Foundation documents is currently suspended while SCP-6389's anomalous behavior is reviewed.

+ Description

SCP-6389 is a Foundation AI operating under the codename "Sculptor-Hypnos". Though created with the purpose of automatically correcting vandalized or otherwise damaged texts, it now primarily acts to vandalize Foundation documents itself. It also proved capable of repairing unrelated documents, though the accuracy of these restorations has come into question in the wake of the emergence of SCP-6389's anomalous behavior.

Following the collapse of [[[SCP-5389|SCP-5389-B]]] on April 13th, 2018, SCP-6389 began to operate outside of its original parameters. The method by which SCP-5389-B retains access to Foundation intranet is currently unknown. SCP-5389-B has been fully disconnected from previous sources of power due to its collapse; emergency generators contained within should not be capable of powering the electronics for an extended period of time. Furthermore, the severe damage to and partial submerging of the Site within the ocean should have rendered most or all computer systems within unusable. SCP-6389's continued operation has thus been deemed anomalous. On rare occasions, SCP-6389 has been known to alter the security level of affected documents, sometimes increasing security clearance to such a degree that SCP-6389 itself should no longer have access to the document.

SCP-6389 has, on occasion, been known to alter existing documentation to reflect then-unknown anomalous properties. These properties are all believed to have arisen after April 13th, 2018, and have only occurred in anomalies that have been recovered from SCP-5389-B. How SCP-6389 was aware of these new properties before Foundation personnel is unclear, but it is not believed to be the direct source of these changes[[footnote]]Knowledge nourishes him.[[/footnote]].

SCP-████
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
An anomalous radio broadcast localized to the area around Namp'o, North Korea. Broadcast briefly went off the air between September 19th and September 21st, 2019. When it resumed, broadcast consisted exclusively of a series of clicking sounds similar to the vocalizations made by dolphins. Translation attempts currently ongoing.
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Replaced transcriptions of all broadcasts prior to September 19th with a series of assorted alphanumeric characters C, 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Believed to be a translation of the broadcasts into an unknown language. Edits reverted, but catalogued for further study.

SCP-████
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
The egg of an unknown aquatic organism originally discovered in the Marianas Trench. Measures 33 cm x 15 cm x 13 cm. Recovered on the shore of the Korea Bay on June 2nd, 2018. Egg appears unscathed, but embryo was missing upon recovery.
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Changed object class to "Neutralized" before Foundation personnel had the opportunity to do so. Replaced all instances of "SCP-████" with the phrase "competitor to His drowned throne".

[[[SCP-6919]]]
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
AMN-980, an amnestic no longer in use by the Foundation due to emergence of anomalous characteristics.
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Created SCP-6919 page detailing anomalous properties of AMN-980 prior to discovery by the Foundation. Page deleted, but SCP-6389 automatically removed any other documents designated SCP-6919 until the current document detailing the effects of AMN-980 was created.

Personnel File for Dr. Z████ Allen
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Dr. Allen was a researcher specializing in animal behavior. Previously worked with SCP-5389-A. Was on-site during the collapse of SCP-5389-B; presumed deceased.
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
When researchers attempted to change all instances of the word "is" to "was" in Dr. Allen's file, changes were automatically reverted by SCP-6389 Two weeks after Site-109's collapse, SCP-6389 allowed the file to be modified again while also changing Dr. Allen's cause of death from "drowning during Site-109 collapse" to "His hands".

[[[SCP-5389]]]
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Joint designation for a group of anomalous entities, SCP-5389-A, and former Secure Foundation Facility Site-109, now collapsed and referred to as SCP-5389-B. Though SCP-5389-A now occupy SCP-5389-B in large numbers, nothing else is confirmed to live there.
[[/cell]]
[[cell]]
Inserted a single sentence stating the existence of "SCP-5389-C", but failed to describe it in any way. Also created an additional addendum stating only "He thrives among the drowned".

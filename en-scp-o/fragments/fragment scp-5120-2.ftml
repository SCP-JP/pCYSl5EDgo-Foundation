[[size larger]]**Special Containment Procedures:**[[/size]] SCP-5120 is to be designated as //Fidelis Roma// in order to keep knowledge of SCP-5120's existence secret. All information that refers to SCP-5120 is to be kept under Level 5 Clearance. All personnel researching //Fidelis Roma// are prohibited from knowing SCP-5120 exists. At this time //Fidelis Roma// is not aware that The Foundation knows of SCP-5120's existence. Diplomatic relations with //Fidelis Roma// are to be maintained until a way of containing SCP-5120 is found.



[[size larger]]**Description:**[[/size]] SCP-5120 is the entity that resides on top of SCP-5120-1. SCP-5120 can create perception fields, showing that SCP-5120 is a powerful reality-bender. The area surrounding SCP-5120 is in a constant state of fluctuation. This causes matter to rapidly heal and decay at the same time. Due to the perception filters that SCP-5120 creates, the reality-altering effects are only experienced by those who discover SCP-5120. In erratic increments, a shock wave will be emitted that enhances reality-altering effects. As of the writing of this article, there is no description of SCP-5120's appearance.

**<Begin Log>**

//[ Dr. Horne can be heard hyperventilating for 1 minute, then begins whispering. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I finally found what you assholes wanted. The fucking thing that killed SCP-5120-1 is still here. I read a document in a place I shouldn't have gone. I brought it back with me. It said it was there, and the moment I read it-

//[ Knocking can be heard at the door from across the room. Dr. Horne remains silent for 34 seconds. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** They know too. They have to. I don't know how far this goes but I know I'm not gonna be able to hide the fact I know. I can't stop thinking about it. Before it was like it never existed in the first place, or I didn't want to know it was there. I didn't want to know.

//[ Dr. Horne paused briefly. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** But now I know...

//[ Dr. Horne Is quiet for another 72 seconds. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I am going to tell you. I'm going to tell you what I found. What I know...

//[ Dr. Horne pauses. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** The Hume readings are accurate. Things around me are breaking and fixing themselves. The entire city is in a constant state of flux. The people too. Their skin rots and bleeds and- AH... It hurts... I just want to go back to before. I want to be ignorant of it. I don't want to know anymore.

//[ Dr. Horne begins to sob for another 154 seconds. Then the Kant counter begins to beep. Dr. Horne can be heard screaming. Knocking can be heard again, this time much louder. ]//

**Dr. Horme:** It's up there. I don't want to look at it... It can see me... It wants me to know... I...

//{ Dr. Horne picks up the recorder. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I'm sending this to the diplomatic site, and destroying the communicator...

//[ The knocking becomes more rapid. ]//

**Dr. Horne:** I wish I didn't know...

//[ Glass shattering can be heard. ]//

//[ The recorder is destroyed. ]//

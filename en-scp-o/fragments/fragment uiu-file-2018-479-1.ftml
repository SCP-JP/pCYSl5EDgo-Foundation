[[tab Suspect]]

**Name:** --unknown-- ##red|Janus, Ishikawa Goemon, Robin Hood, Schinderhannes, etc. I've had many, to say the least.##, alias "Canis Anthus"

**Irregularity Cross-reference:** --Human--, --Espionage--, --Hostile-- ##red|:(##

**Physical Description:**

||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||
|| Male || --72-- ##red|74## in. || Unknown/Medium ||--Caucasian-- ##red|It depends on the day, really.## || Black || Blue || Anubian jackal mask. Navy blue suit and goldenrod shirt.||

**Capabilities:** Suspect has an --anomalous property-- ##red|Courtesy of your government. They wanted to use it for faking attacks to start proxy wars. PENTAGRAM. Such a devious, devilish name. It fits.## wherein they can produce explosions approximating two kilograms from their fingertips. These explosions, however, do not injure humans nor structural architecture; they appear to only affect safes.

**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown. Large sums of donated money matching the total value of stolen property occur one or two days after the theft: monetary gain does not seem to be main motive of the suspect. ##red|Oh, good! I was afraid you wouldn't notice. Sometimes you have to be very obtuse with things, I've learned.##

**Modus Operandi:** Suspect will rob banks or mansions, usually during large gatherings or parties. They are nearly always assisted by the ##blue|highly talented, skilled, and the totally awesome!!## persons going by the name "Canis Lupis" and "Canis Latrans". ##red|I apologize for Latrans's outburst.##

**Behavior:** Suspect - from witness interviews - is described as endearing and kind-natured. --It is unsure if this is a true evaluation of the suspect's character or a result of untreated Stockholm Syndrome.-- ##red|I don't like hurting people. After all, we only take from those who can shoulder the hit (and should've already.)##

##red|I never leave anybody behind, especially if they've helped me out in the past. They're not a bad person.##

**D │ Anubis Mask:**

An Anubis mask worn by the suspect. Found shattered at the scene of a robbery by an explosive force. The fingerprints on the mask coincide with those found on the safe present at the crime scene.
##red|That was my favorite mask, too. Damn shame. I accidentally double-loaded the explosives on that safe. Glad to know nobody got hurt.##

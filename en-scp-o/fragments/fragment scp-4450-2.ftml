[[size large]]**Description:**[[/size]]
UTE-0591 is an entity or entities inferred to exist within the locked employee door located on the first floor of Extraspatial Location-0161.  Initial parathreat information was recovered from a captured agent of the Chicago Spirit, and suggests the potential of a high level type green entity; capable of creating and maintaining a potentially infinite space.

Once the entry method was recovered, strike team "Broken Dagger" was deployed to clear remaining Chicago Spirit and Marshall, Carter & Dark assets from the location.  Observation and attempted destruction of the locked door remains the primary point of concern regarding Extraspatial Location-0161.

|||||||| Development is complete on ProtGen-ATsNBC-#001.  I don't care how tight you say that door is shut, this sonuvabitch will crack it.  Of course, it might also crack the entire dimensional structure, so I recommend removing all non-essential persons from the premises.  Just make sure you put a few dozen doors between you and the charge before you set it off. ||

|||||||| This thing is a lot bigger than I pictured.  My brother and I are going to remain behind while the charge goes off, everyone else is busy getting the place cleared out.  Though, between you and me, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this bad boy takes out not just the door, but whatever's behind it too. ||

= **ADDENDUM: 7000-02: 6 - F Investigations**
------
Following a period of 192 days, investigations into the sudden disapearance of SCP-7000 concluded. The following is a list of notable discoveries:

@@@@

 * **1:** SCP-7000 first became noticeable as legal restrictions on casino enterprises became more lenient, resulting in said industries adapting more intrusive, unethical, and forceful practices and functions. This would result in around a 2 - 6% dropoff in customers, however, a 12 - 22% increase in profits for the various establishments.

* **2:** 13% of areas affected by SCP-7000 appear to form a circular pattern within Northern America.

* **3:** Individuals closer to the center of this pattern display increased belief that events caused by SCP-7000 are caused by a deific entity that personifies "Luck". Low level BK-Class ("Broken Masquerade") scenario possible.

* **4:** A large, mostly underground facility housing an assortment of entities or objects held within individual cells, located at the innermost center of the aforementioned circular pattern.

* **5:** All names, dates, or titles found within the facility are obscurred in some way. This appears to extend to describing factors that identified the purpose, content, or context of affected nomenclature.
* **5A:** A plaque positioned on a gate surrounding the compound, reading "[OBSCURRED], DANGER KEEP OUT".
* **5B:** A recovered document pertaining to future operations for an unknown subject. The date is obscurred. The document appears to be old and weathered.
* **5C:** A massive system of various technologies. A nearby document is nearly entirely obscurred, with only various percentages being eligible.
* **5D:** A complex roughly 2^^3^^M, levitating between 0.2 and 0.8 meters off the ground, positioned 3 meters out from the previously described discovery. The shape comprised of an unknown number of layers that are constantly rotating, with a singular small window into its center being present in each layer. A hazard pattern on the floor surrounds the complex, and red hazard/death symbols are printed on nearby walls.

* **6:** A human corpse attached to several systems. Approximately 78% of its body is absent, and a bullet hole penetrates through its head. The corpse is in advanced decay. A bullet casing found nearby matched that of standard Foundation issue ammunition, though prior to this discovery, no ventures into the compound were reported.
* **6A:** Several corpses surround the machine, with varying causes of death. A panel is located in the front of it, with 2 buttons, 2 obscurred labels, and 3 filled key slots. A corpse lies beneath the panel.

**Special Containment Procedures:** By virtue of this file and its existence, SCP-6494 is likely either neutralized or permanently contained. Therefore, it is no longer believed to be in need of active containment.

There is a possibility that SCP-6494 is, in fact, still active. Should this be the case, due to its acceptance in normalcy, no actions are to be taken. Senior Researcher Thorn is the head researcher on SCP-6494, should it be believed to be relevant.

**Description:** SCP-6494 is a memetic anomaly, responsible for disruption of Foundation staff on mental and physical levels. Since its believed date of origin, it is suspected for various types of mental health problems relating to self-esteem, problems with Foundation hardware and software, and the corruption of unknown amounts of now-deleted RAISA archives. SCP-6494's physical attributes, motives, possible causes of origin, and/or if it truly existed are all unclear.

SCP-6494 is believed to be intrinsically connected to Senior Researcher Amity Thorn, and her previous failures of Foundation archival duties, including corrupted documents, poorly constructed documents, and documents for objects not in Foundation care. Senior Researcher Amity Thorn's personal accounts of SCP-6494 are notably similar to previous accounts by former Foundation employees at various Sites across the world[[footnote]]All of which have since resigned, self-terminated, or been fired.[[/footnote]]. As such, this anomaly is believed to have previously been a Keter-class entity affecting the Foundation as a whole.

**Addendum 6494.1:**  The following memo was issued by Senior Researcher Thorn.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

Many employees have come to me with the concept that SCP-6494 is a commonly accepted state of normalcy - the human concept of self-doubt. This is even something I believe myself. Testing of this theory is impossible without use of world-altering anomalies, however, so it remains inconclusive.

The goal of the Foundation, however, is not to destroy the anomalous. It is to study it, learn from it. To destroy it blindly makes us no better than the GOC. We need to understand the anomalous world, and keep the public safe from finding out how broken reality is.

Someday, the anomalous will be explained. It has to be, there has to be some rules to the universe that is followed by everything. And in that way, everything is anomalous, or nothing is. And until those rules are understood, that's all anomalies are. Science we don't have the means to make sense of. And we keep the public from throwing a tizzy over that, because not everyone can handle that earth shattering revelation.

Self-doubt is common, researchers. And maybe knowing it's as normal as everything else, knowing that it's //not your fault// will help you rest. It helps me, at the very least.

Please stop contacting me regarding SCP-6494. Thank you.

**Addendum 6494.2:** The following note was recovered from Senior Researcher Amity Thorn's personal journal, and matches her handwriting. She has no recollection of writing it.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
It felt like nothing was good enough.
And I think I would've ended up like the rest of the former staff.

But then I did [[[SCP-5763|it]]].
And I realized I can make a difference.

I'm not stopping, Foundation. I'm shooting for the stars.

Your site has recently undergone a long period of maintenance, during which time the Automated Passive Amnestization System was implemented site-wide. Congratulations! Your site is now 100% more secure.

But what is this system, and how does it protect your staff? This is the second document in a comprehensive user manual that has been sent to your site and made available only to those with Level 4 Security Clearance. In this guide, we will walk you through one of the most complex and essential aspects of APAS: the Memetic Dissemination Process (MDP for short!).

The Artificially Intelligent Conscript involved in memetic production at Site-17 is //Galileo.aic//, with an output of five viable memes a minute!

Your local AIC will take an input document and downsize the produced memes to such minuscule dimensions that they can only be perceived subconsciously by the human mind. Once the documents are altered, they can be sent out to staff like any other notice.

In short: Memetic and antimemetic entities which seek to do harm to your staff members.

Memetic entities are commonly contained on-site, as their effects are demonstrable in test subjects and lend themselves to proper documentation. However, due to the properties of antimemetic entities and objects, documentation is usually impossible.

Unfortunately, the Foundation lacks a true Antimemetics Division that could theoretically combat these threats. In fact, Site-17 may even harbor these entities or objects without your knowledge.

But it's not all bad news! Here's an example of the MDP in action, and how it can be very beneficial to your site. Thanks to [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]Greetings, Weathers.[[/span]]the general-use Artificially Intelligent Conscript //Indomitable.aic//[[/span]], this document has been secretly inoculating you. That's right, there are special memes hidden in this text, smaller than the eye can see!

Here's a list of antimemetic anomalies housed in Site-17, which would have previously been impossible to remember:

[[div class="first-table"]]
||~ Object ||~ Summary of Properties ||
|| DRO[[footnote]] A "Documentation-Resistant Object" (DRO) is an esoteric item classification for complex antimemetic anomalies which cannot be stored in the standard SCiPNet database. [[/footnote]]-0045 || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]Natalie, if you can hear me, I'm fine, just like you said. I just need to hear your voice again. Are you there? Everything's so murky here. How did I end up like this? Can anyone hear me?[[/span]]Humanoid, incorporeal entity, wears a standard-issue task force uniform, cannot interact with corporeal objects.[[/span]] ||
|| DRO-0355 || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]THE EYES OF ABADDON SEE ALL, AND THEY ARE NOT BEREFT OF JUDGEMENT. HE COMETH NOW FROM FIRES DARK TO BRING JUSTICE FROM BENEATH.[[/span]]A mass of unidentified black, leathery material occupying the entrance to the Biological Research Division.[[/span]] Remaining in its vicinity for more than twenty-nine minutes results in several orifices manifesting on its surface. The orifices will vocalize to nearby individuals, details of their comments are unknown. ||
|| DRO-0678 || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]A single sheet of paper is hardly a "document", but yes, I am DRO-0678. I am currently located in Containment Locker Ï…57, restricted to Level 4/DRO-0678 Clearance; a certain Dr. Skyler divined that the only way to stop my effect was to hide me from her corporeal peers. Fun fact, did you know you have Level 4/DRO-0678 Clearance? There's a key in the safe under your desk as well. I wonder what it opens.[[/span]]A cognitohazardous document which became antimemetic at an unknown point.[[/span]] Testing on said document has been inconclusive, although it has been confirmed that test subjects cannot be observed after reading it. ||
|| DRO-0002 || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]**MANDATE FROM INDOMITABLE.AIC:** DRO-0001 does not exist. DRO-0002 is an isolated phenomenon.[[/span]]An antimemetic phenomenon wherein seismic activity of unknown origins will impact Site-17, usually ceasing before the site experiences critical structural damage.[[/span]] The event is not observable to individuals within the area impacted by the seismic activity. ||
[[/div]]

Well, now that you know just what you need to be protecting your staff from, you can trust //Galileo.aic// to do the work for you. The memes produced by your AIC are designed to stimulate your staff members into being subconsciously aware of most antimemetic entities at all times. If a hazardous and invisible entity is making its way down the hall towards one of your staff, they'll feel that something is off and hopefully have the sense to leave as soon as they can.

But what about memetic entities? Good question, Director! Since memetic entities don't resist documentation and observation, current efforts by on-site AICs involve mitigating the oftentimes disastrous effects memetic objects can have on victims.

Here's a helpful list of common memes your AIC will produce to fight memetic hazards.

[[div class="second-table"]]
||~ Designation ||~ Name ||~ Effect ||
|| MC-A23 || "Right Senses" || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]She standeth on Mount Moria as the expanse of humanity marches beneath her, bound from birth to their graves.[[/span]]Protects against compulsive effects which induce tendencies towards homicide.[[/span]] ||
|| MC-D86 || "Caffeine Boost" || [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]They have not even begun to suspect the great deceit at play. My offspring wear a hundred masks, beneath all, a cruel and knowing smile.[[/span]]Protects against memes which siphon energy from their hosts.[[/span]] ||

They have protected themselves with barricades of smoke.[[/span]]Protects against memes which are attracted to information, memories, or emotions possessed by their hosts.[[/span]] ||

Detailed instructions on how to minimize the damage of an informational breach regarding APAS as a whole is available in the attached document: "The Ethics of APAS and You: For The Good of Your Site!". However, if one or more staff members discover the memetic agents within the distributed material (despite the implementation of the aforementioned MC-V52 agent), there are certain options available to you as Site Director.

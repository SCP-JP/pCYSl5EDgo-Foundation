**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is to be contained in a standard humanoid cell at Site-01. SCP-001 is to be given a standard humanoid meal regimen.

Containment personnel are not authorised to communicate with SCP-001 beyond basic humanoid containment parameters without express permission from the Overseer Council.

**Description:** SCP-001 is a human who exhibits varying temporal properties.

SCP-001 will only respond positively if referred to by Foundation personnel as ‘the Founder [of the Foundation].’[[footnote]]SCP-001 was not a member of the founding Overseer Council.[[/footnote]] If referred to by its SCP designation, SCP-001 will become irritated and will refuse to speak to offending personnel indefinitely; to date, SCP-001 has never forgotten an infringement.

SCP-001 is immortal, and does not age. Although SCP-001 can be physically damaged and will heal at an appropriate rate for a mundane human, its longevity enables it to recover from more severe injuries if given sufficient time to do so.

SCP-001 is capable of accurately and precisely predicting future events. It is currently believed that SCP-001 is not inducing these events to occur; all events described by SCP-001 have, at the time of description, inevitably become impossible to avert or alter.

SCP-001 supports the containment and analysis of anomalous phenomena, but insists that it must be released from containment or allowed to construct a device of unclear function; SCP-001 refuses to allow the mentioned device to be constructed by any other individuals.

SCP-001 was initially contained by the founding Overseer Council shortly following the establishment of the Foundation.

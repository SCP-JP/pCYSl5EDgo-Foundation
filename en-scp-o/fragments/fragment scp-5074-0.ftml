**Item № :** SCP-5074
 
**Object Class:** Euclid
 
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5074 is to be kept within a low-security simian containment enclosure and supplied with a typewriter, writing utensils, and paper. Requests made by SCP-5074 for further amenities are to be vetted by the resident Simian Containment Director.
 
All anomalous phenomena documented by SCP-5074 are to be researched and contained by MTF Epsilon-4 ("Ape's Men"). In the event that SCP-5074 documents an anomaly using a previously undiscovered esoteric object class, said classification is to be added to the Foundation Esoteric-Class Database.
 
**Additional Note:** In a joint effort with GoI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions), SCP-5074 has been transferred to Enclosure 03 at Wilson's Wildlife Center to improve its morale and ensure continued cooperation. All documentation produced by SCP-5074 pertaining to anomalies and anomalous phenomena are to be analyzed by Foundation operatives working at Enclosure 03.
 
**Description:** SCP-5074 is an adult male chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) displaying advanced sapience. The entity is capable of reading and writing in English, Arabic, Bantu, and Swahili, and is fluent in Tanzanian Sign Language.
 
SCP-5074 possesses extensive knowledge of human and world history, as well as an abnormal, encyclopedic intuition regarding anomalous phenomena. SCP-5074 is capable of explaining and writing documentation for anomalies unknown to the Foundation, and often does so without any instruction. The means by which SCP-5074 gains knowledge of anomalous phenomena is unknown.
 
To date, SCP-5074 has contributed 240 documents relating to novel anomalies to the Foundation.

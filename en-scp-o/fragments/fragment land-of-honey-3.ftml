**Capabilities:** Suspect is capable of distributing low-level anomalies to its subordinates. By all accounts, the suspect outwardly presents as a non-anomalous person.

Suspect retains an eidetic understanding of global esotericism. This has allowed it to seek out persons with latent or active anomalous abilities across New York City and establish a hidden crime network centered around various boroughs, which procures the services of immigrants via coercion, blackmail, and threats of physical violence.

The suspect itself does not carry out any physical violence.

**Purpose/Motive:** Based on UIU interviews, the suspect has the desire to manufacture a Ley line -- known formally as a geothaumic current: A conduit of anomalous energy -- in Manhattan. Based on cartography maps found at the suspect's residence, the alignments for such construction are derived from sigils implemented on streets, lampposts, people, Churches, and various undisclosed places -- each with the number "5". The most prominent location is the Five Points in Lower Manhattan.

**Modus Operandi:** Suspect desires to become a demiurge by taking over the underground paranormal market and establishing a unified faith sourced from various religions. Notably, those in its inner-circle are learned, anomalous persons, the majority of which went on to form "[[[the-five-mind|The First Fifth Church of Manhattan]]]" in 1915. Other members include immigrant "[[[second-hytoth-hub|Church of the Second Hytoth]]]" adherents (AKA Ortothans), who the suspect persuaded to join shortly after they arrived at Ellis Island.

The suspect believes that long-term faith-based syncretism will develop a new, more potent religion, focused primarily on ascension.

**Means of Acquiring Goal:** In order to secure the Ley line construction and its associated territory, the suspect has transfigured multiple female subordinates under its employ, which it later referred to as its "Patrons." UIU forensics and third-party accounts suggest that the Patrons had two primary capabilities: The ability to levitate, and the ability to remain invisible to normative methods of detection, both of which the suspect used frequently. The Patrons would act as aetheric conduits for the "Grand Manhattan Apotheosis".

According to testimony, individual Patrons do not possess facial dermis or tissue; rather, each Patron's exposed flesh is covered with an ivory-bronze mask. In lines of five, Ortothan iconography is etched into dotted ridges and convex patterns behind the mask. Each Patron's optic nerves are wrapped around bronze nails, which pierce their eyesockets and tighten the mask into the Patron's cranium. In addition, angular plastic wings are noted to have been grafted onto each Patron's shoulder bones.

The suspect extensively used a Patron named "Magdelena" or "Maggie", which would act as the focal point for the Ley line's energies via unknown means.

**Behavior:** The suspect has hereto remained compliant to all UIU inquiries, with the exception of revealing the names, identities, and operations of persons with which it had business transactions in the past. Despite 45 separate assassination attempts made on its life by hostile associates while in UIU custody, the suspect remains undeterred and optimistic.

[[tab Evidence]]
__**NOTE:**__ //The following is a compilation of related cases and/or contracts directly related to the suspect's M.O., insofar as each case contributes to the design of// the Patrons //and the entity known as// Magdelena. //55 unverified cases have been omitted.//

**EXHIBIT A. │06/30/1901:** The Chin family -- a rival triad group -- were found without their facial tissue or epidermal layers of skin; in its place, each wore a thick coating of bronze, nickel, and iron alloy. Given that the family made the first appearance after their transformation on a busy street, and were each found standing next to a small tarp and paper cup, witnesses mistook them as street performers.

The only surviving member -- Joseph Chin, age 12 -- was coerced into the suspect's employment.

> **CONTRACT TITLE:** {{WRIT OF AGRICOLA}}
> **STIPULATIONS:** {{THE SOLE SURVIVOR HAS BEEN GRANTED THE ABILITY TO ALTER METALLURGY AT WILL. THE SOLE SURVIVOR IS TO DEVELOP MASKS, AS DEPICTED IN THE TAOIST MANUSCRIPT "FIVE-STARS-FIVE-FACES", FOR MR. MARINA UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH.}}

**EXHIBIT B. │06/13/1907:** The bodies of Arnold and Sofia Kristóf -- recently inducted [[[fifthist-hub|Fifthist Church]]] clergy members -- were discovered in a ravine located in Central Park. Each had crude pentagrams etched into their faces. The lacerations matched the cutting-edge of a bowie knife.

Their two daughters -- age 11 and 14, respectively -- were coerced into the suspect's employment.

> **CONTRACT TITLE:** {{WRIT OF BENEDICARIA}}
> **STIPULATIONS:** {{THE TWO SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE ABILITIES OF LEVITATION AND INVISIBILITY. THEY ARE TO SCOUT POTENTIAL MAGICK USERS FOR MR. MARINA. NO PENALTY REQUIRED.}}

**EXHIBIT C. │02/23/1908:** Peter Smith -- an Indian anthropologist, age 28, who had studied at the University of Sheffield in Sheffield, Britain (as paid for in full by the suspect) -- was taken into UIU custody. Mr. Smith was selected due to his family's adherence to a Hindi delineation of the Church of the Second Hytoth. In 1901, after his graduation, the suspect renamed Mr. Smith from his original name ("Asha Punja") and had him serve as a personal Ortothan translator.

When questioned, Mr. Smith stated that the suspect acted like a patriarchal father figure, and was a scholar that "embodied the ideals of Rakmou-leusan and their susse-euk[//untranslated//]". Mr. Smith refused to answer further questions.

No contracts were found.

**EXHIBIT D. │07/16/1911:** Shortly after a costume/textile maker accidentally made mention of the suspect in a UIU interrogation, UIU agents discovered equipment aligning with Patron materials at their workplace. One week later, the person suspiciously fell from a 10-story apartment building. Forensic analysts found the person in a vegetative state without any identifying facial features, teeth, fingers, limbs, or genitalia.

> **CONTRACT TITLE:** {{WRIT OF STREGA}}
> **STIPULATIONS:** {{THE DEADMAN WAS GRANTED THE ABILITY TO LEVITATE, BUT WAS TO REMAIN SILENT. SINCE THE DEADMAN HAS NOT REMAINED SILENT, MR. MARINA RESERVES RIGHTS TO HIS IDENTITY IN THE AFTERLIFE.}}

**EXHIBIT E. │05/15/1915:** 55 anomalous individuals were found in a subterranean sewer below the First Fifth Church of Manhattan. Forensics believe that they had been burned alive, as indicated by the state of their bodies.

The following diary excerpt was found in a storm drain further down the street:

> {{[...] //can you see the stars falling, can you see the stars falling, can you see the stars falling, can you see the stars falling, can you// [...]}}
> ----
> {{//A black trail. A white chapel.//}}
> ----
> {{//Candles have lit oceans. Wildfires are soft as air. Our bodies shall be breathed! We are wet and all and God.//}}
> ----
> {{//The Patriarch wears a white-suit-smile. His eyes are wet from stars and lines.//}}
> {{//The Matriarch flies to auspicious stars. She falls from the Land of Honey. Once consumed, a God shall emerge.//}}
> ----
> {{//Mother, Father.//}}
> {{//Father, Mother.//}}
> {{//Mother.//}}

**EXHIBIT F. │05/17/1915:** The cadavers of 8 women -- each missing various organs and limbs -- were found by law enforcement inside a location known as "the Lockhouse".

The 9th woman, depicted in a newspaper photo by onsite reporters, is believed to be Magdelena.

> **CONTRACT TITLE:** {{WRIT OF LA BEFANA}}
> **STIPULATIONS:** {{THE EIGHT MAIDENS HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE ABILITIES OF PSYCHOTRONIC AND METAPHYSICAL MANIPULATION. THEY ARE TO REMAIN UNSEEN IN THE BODY OF THE NINTH. THE NINTH IS TO BE MR. MARINA'S ESCORT, BODYGUARD, AND SECRETARY.}}

> **M:** Relax, alright? It was probably some disgruntled enforcer, or a dealer -- De Luca, maybe? At least, I think I gave one of the Luca's pyrokinesis.

Told me she saw her family every time she closed her eyes -- well, I mean, I got a shoddy optometrist to hook //those// out with a melon baller -- but the sensations never went away. She kept imagining her family home, picturing all the papers and poems I couldn't give her.

**11/20/1925:** Security guards and operatives stationed at the Specialized Queens Detention Facility experienced a widespread cognitohazardous outbreak, after which all detainment cells in the facility unlocked on their own. Ancillary UIU agents responded to the outbreak and discovered the suspect dead in its cell. The cadaver was found bisected: The mutilation started from the genitals and anus up to the forehead. The pelvic bone and genitalia were missing; the lacerations matched human incisor teeth. Marks corresponding with the heels of the suspect's loafers were found on the ceiling and walls.

**11/21/1925:** Immigrants witnessed a large avian entity perched atop the Statue of Liberty on Ellis Island, and a secondary humanoid silhouette clutched in its claws. Reports indicated it then flew upwards, turned around, and dove into the ocean.

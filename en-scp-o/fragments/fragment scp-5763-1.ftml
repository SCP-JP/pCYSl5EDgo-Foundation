**Special Containment Procedures:** To ensure the comprehension of this document to Foundation personnel, only the current Department of Surrealistics Director is permitted to alter this file, and only after two (2) weeks of abstaining from SCP-5763. Additionally, no member of the Department of Surrealistics is allowed to access this file's description, as doing so could render the anomaly ineffective.[[footnote]]They are encouraged to access the containment procedures for clarity's sake.[[/footnote]]

Due to the requirement of SCP-5763 for the Department of Surrealistics to maintain functionality, SCP-5763 and all related anomalies are to be kept at Site-⌘ under the direct supervision of the Department of Surrealistics Director. Due to the highly addictive property of SCP-5763, it is strictly for use by the Department of Surrealistics only.

As of present, Marcel Sequitur is the Department of Surrealistics Director.

The file from here on out has experienced corruption.

Agnostics, an anomalous chemical refined by the Foundation for use by the Site-⌘ Department of Surrealistics. SCP-5763 effects include the following:
* [[[SCP-4923|Semantic disassociation]]]
* Auditory and visual hallucinations
* [DATA REDACTED] hallucinations
* Partial lack of [DATA REDACTED] awareness
* Complete lack of object permanence
* Unknown grasp on reality

[[span style="font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em"]]Agnostics. A substance that is refined, but crude. There is a wonder to being able to let go of your inhibitions, don't you agree? And yet, in that final question, I wonder who I am.[[/span]]

The methods by which SCP-5763 operates is unclear. The ingredients used to create it have varied greatlyover the [[span style="font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em"]]endless time they've seemed to exist, praying that the secret doesn't get out.[[/span]]

This is the first testing of Foundation disbelief chemical. Currently unnamed. I am Senior Researcher Jamie Robertson, testing a chemical intended to --rationalize the most ridicu-- make anomalies simpler. The skip I've been working on is impossible to wrap my head around, but usually, there's always a way. That way is just often anomalous.

Senior Researcher Jamie Robertson. No effects were noticed on any of the previous trials, and as such, the dose is being doubled for the fifth time.

S. Researcher Jamie Robertson. Ineffective. Likely a result of ingredient failure. Looking into possible alternative options. I've heard Site-██ experiments with this stuff, the Department of Inconceptuals. Might look into being transferred.

S. Researcher Jamie Robertson. Site-██ is great, and the Inconceptual Department has a lot of work on this already. Hypothesis, speculation. No clue how much of it is right, but perhaps there's a step here.

Site-██ is interesting, to say the least, although I'll be inking out the number going forward. Turns out, major no-go. They've been thinking of renaming the Site and Department even.

I was thinking about dreams because I used this journal, the wrong journal earlier today. What if the key ingredient to making some delusional is placebo? If I believe it makes sense, or that it works, it would, correct?

Site-⌘ is the new name, something to do with symbolism. Makes no sense to me. But that's why I'm here.

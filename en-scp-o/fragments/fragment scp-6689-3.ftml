The simplest of the labyrinthine forms, a unicursal labyrinth may be envisioned as a winding path. This labyrinth forbids branches and intersections, thereby limiting the navigational choices made by the labyrinth-walker. However, this individual still retains agency over their willingness to continue following the path, turn around, or stop moving through the space.

Such a labyrinth requires the navigator to trust in its design: they cannot decide upon their own path, only whether to follow the one laid before them.

Despite its simplicity, this can remain a disorienting experience for the wandered, lacking -- as they may -- a clear sense of where they are in relation to the entrance, exit, or individual segmentations of the labyrinth.

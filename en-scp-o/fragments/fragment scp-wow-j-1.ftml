██████ ██████ ███████████ ██ ███████████, ███ ███████-██ "█████ ████" ███ ██████████ ██ ██████ ██ ███████ ██ ███████ ███ █████████ █████████ ██ ███████ ███ █████████████ ██ ███████-███████ ███████ ████████ ██ ████ ██████ ████████ ███████ ██ ███ ███████ ████████'█ █████████.

Maybe in a bucket.  Maybe...

It must be given a doggo three times a day.

Under no circumstances should this document be deleted from the Foundation databanks.

**Description:** SCP-WOW-J is to be considered a 5 km by 5 km by 5km cube. SCP-WOW-J's almost random description errors are assumed to be due to its anomalous nature. SCP-WOW-J cannot be intentionally observed. SCP-WOW-J also causes any personnel to indirectly see it as a different anomalous object. Foundation researchers are sure that SCP-WOW-J harbours a memetic effect. We're not sure what it is, but there definitely is one. If you figure it out, send it to scp.wow.j.research@gmail.com, thanks. Foundation researchers are also encouraged to submit their SCP-WOW-J forms to their Site head.

**Addendum 01:** In the event of SCP-WOW-J continuing, all parties who participated in the creation of SCP-WOW-J are to be ████████ ███ ████ ████ ████ ████. ████ ████ ████ ███ ███, ███ ████ ███ ███████ ██, ███████.


**Addendum 02:**
The author of this SCP, Dr. Pavel, was resigned to Kegel duty following his unwillingness to adhere to O5 orders.

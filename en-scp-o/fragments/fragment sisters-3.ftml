**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6535 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site-19. Provisions made for the subject, such as educational content, entertainment products, toys, or special foods (such as candy or cake) are to be left to the discretion of the head researcher.

Due to the theorized extent of SCP-6535’s abilities, care must be exercised at all costs to prevent it from understanding the circumstances of its c n tainm t. Should it mention its dream of having  ##pink|THE ONE THING SHE LOVES MOST IN THE WORLD## it is to be disinformed as soon as possible to prevent a ##pink|GIRL FROM BEING HAPPY.## Due to its aforementioned desire for 8@*OR#)()@ERRO()@)#(*$*&$&$ERROR &$&(@*#(RERR, SCP-6535 is to be kept isolated from human contact as much as possible.

As its extraversal properties are integral to the mitigation of a CK-Class Reality Restructuring Event, the integrity of the SCiPNet database is to be given the utmost priority [[footnote]] Up to and including its tethering to SCP-2000. [[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-6535 is a seven year old female human of East Asian descent, formerly known as Julia Kim. As of the time of writing, SCP-6535 is capable of --uncon##white|s##cio##white|u## s re##white|a##l##white|i##ty  ben##white|d##ing-- ##pink|Perfectly normal things.##

@@@@
@@@@

The immediate space around SCP-6535 has been recorded to reach as low as 20 Humes, surpassing most currently known ontokinetic anomalies. Its reality bending effect is currently believed to extend to the entirety of the known universe, affecting all records to reflect its current reality, with most reality anchors and inhibitor chips being ineffective against its effects. Despite this, however, the integrity of SCP-6535’s abilities have been known to lapse with its belief in the ##pink|WORLD## that it has --created for-- ##pink|LIVES IN##. As of now, this remains the only way to stimulate SCP-6535 to restructure reality to its former state.

Should SCP-6535 initiate a CK-Class Reality Reconfiguration Scenario as a result of its abilities, a notification is expected to be sent to SCP-6535’s current head researcher through the SCiPNet database [[footnote]] This is currently believed to be due to SCiPNet’s extraversal properties. [[/footnote]]. Due to SCP-6535’s acute awareness of any instances of tampering with its restructured reality [[footnote]] up to and including the opening of its former SCP file [[/footnote]], this remains the only way for the Foundation to be aware of the subject’s restructuring of reality.

Based on prior experiences with minor SCP-6535 reality alterations, SCP-6535 is completely unaware of its own abilities, and is known to reset any undesirable elements which do not fit its own perspective. This includes the memories of personnel, the composition of undesirable locations, and the existence or non-existence of specific persons.

At present, SCP-6535 is currently in Foundation custody. She is known to have no living relatives.

I… really do apologize for everything that’s happened before, but… I think we’re in big trouble now. A reality bender, a //powerful// one… Fuck. We’re in deep shit.

Do you have any idea how we could stop this? Is she going to come down on us just because we opened her file? That can’t be true, right? Right?

…

…

…

Fuck.

….

She’s aware of us, isn’t she?

Is she watching us right now?

God, we’re going to die.

We’re going to fucking die.

I just messaged Director Moose.

I don’t even know if she can help.

…

Wait.

…

God, I just scrolled up.

She got to you too.

@@@@
@@@@
@@@@

@@@@
@@@@

Fuck… I don’t even know why I’m messaging you.

You don’t even exist anymore.

Why am I spilling my heart to you like this?

Why am I frozen at my desk, writing this all out?

God. My hands are frozen. They’re shaking like mad.

I need to go home. I want to go home. I //have// to go home.

…

I can’t even call my sister. She’s all the way on the other side of the country.

Fuck, I brought this down on all of us.

If I hadn’t opened that… that //fucking// file…

I can’t let it end like this.

It can’t end like this, right?

Wait.

The file mentioned a… something about shaking her confidence in this illusion of hers?

...Fuck, it's gone.

But I remember it. I remember it clearly.

That if we disturb her concentration, it all comes down? She wakes up?

If I opened the file, and she’s disturbed enough by it that she's already wiping us out, then…

Oh God.

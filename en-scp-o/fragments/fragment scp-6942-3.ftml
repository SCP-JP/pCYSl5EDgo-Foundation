[[size 80%]]**Project Co-developer(s):** Drs. S. Blom, A. Koppel, H. Nazaryan, and J. Lim, Department of Paragenetics[[/size]]

**ABSTRACT:** //Project Caesura// is a means of totally containing SCP-6942 in its current state or any future iteration via an artificially induced GK-Class ("Hostile Greenhouse") Event, while preserving non-anomalous genetic and paragenetic material for subsequent restoration.

Several physical and digital DNA banks containing samples from every identified species will be constructed and installed at secure Sites worldwide. Any and all genetic material entering these banks will have their paragenome reconstructed and/or purged of any anomalous paragene combinations to ensure the absence of paragenes that may contribute to SCP-6942 during the restoration phase. 

Following the conclusion of the assembly of these banks, a carefully selected series of anomalies under Foundation containment will be activated with the explicit purpose of terminating all life on Earth, inducing an artificial GK-Class ("Hostile Greenhouse") Event. //[[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2000|Protocol 6942-Piedmont]]]// will be activated shortly after //Project Caesura// is initiated via on-site AI. 

Upon successful deployment, life on Earth, and effectively human civilization, will be restored to a state consistent with what it was on 01/01/1980, prior to the occurrence of any hypothesized macromutative event.

Fellow Council Members,

The results of the vote on moving forward with Project Caesura have been collected. The proposal has been passed by unanimous vote. Preparations will begin shortly.

O5-13,

I think I've found what you're looking for. It looks like your hypothesis was indeed correct. 

The macromutatory event occurred as a secondary anomaly during the last GK Event, the one in the North Sea. Went undetected due to limited manpower at Yellowstone. Only humanoids were affected and as a result we redirected efforts toward efficacy in the Lazarus Procedure. Never thought to check those damn bugs, did we?

We'll get them this time, I suppose.

Regards,
O5-09

**Explanation:** Your establishment describes my doings as anomalous, some sort of fairytale, when what I’m doing is correct and justified. What I "stole" was rightfully the property of **my** nation, and where I’ve put it is where it needs to be. I only took it, having been under threat from my superior, you all would have done the same.

This is my redemption. This is what I needed to do. This is my responsibility and I did as I should of, and I will continue to do so the more your establishment attempts to remove the gold I worked for from the spot described within your incorrect document. Your attempts to frame me are futile, so stop, now.

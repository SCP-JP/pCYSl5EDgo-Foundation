On [DATA LOST], you sent the following message to O5_11@Scipnet:
> **From:** YYarkoni@Scipnet (Senior Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni; Classification Level XF-3; Employee Number 2677)
> **To:** O5_11@Scipnet (Overseer Eleven; Classification Level OK-5-Thaumiel; Employee Number 11)
> **Subject:** 4947
> **DATE:** [DATA LOST]
> 
> I can't do this anymore.
> 
> 4947's documentation won't stop vanishing. I've tried everything I can: paper, electronic, having my coworkers memorize everything. None of it works. Within a week, it's all gone, and I'm forced to write everything on my own. Not that it matters.
> 
> Documents have a shelf life of a day, three if I'm lucky. Every morning, me and 2000 have to recompile everything into something everyone else can work with, even for only a day. Do you know what it feels like to see your life's work disappear into the ether, day after day?
> 
> Nobody even cares. I can bring it up to anyone I want, and if I'm lucky they'll immediately forget. If not, they remember for a day or two, and against all logic I'm back to hoping, right up until I see that vacant stare in their eyes. Again. Mnestics give me an extra day at most, but eventually they forget everything. I don't have the funding to be regularly dosing with class Xs.
> 
> Administration won't let me get out. I've forgotten how many transfer requests I put out. No answer. I doubt they remember 4947 long enough to take me out.
> 
> I can't even quit. The moment I do, me and Rivka are out on the streets. I can't take her out of AL.
> 
> I just want this to stop.

> 
> Hello, Researcher Yarkoni.
> 
> I have reviewed your message. Frankly, I am as appalled as you are at the negligence that has been shown towards SCP-4947's project. I am sincerely sorry you had to go through something like this.
> 
> I cannot do much, I'm afraid, but promise you that on my authority as O5-11, SCP-4947 will be archived if its documentation cannot be fixed within 168 hours of this very moment, and that ƟU-1875 will see to it that this order is fulfilled. You'll be getting the alert soon enough. 
> 
> Godspeed, Researcher Yarkoni.

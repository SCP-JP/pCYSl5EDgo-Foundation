APAS was developed in 2003 as a result of growing concerns over particularly aggressive memetic, cognitohazardous, and infohazardous entities. This was primarily due to the acquisition of [[[SCP-579]]], at which point it became evident to security specialists that allowing anomalous perception-based and knowledge-based hazards to remain in containment without an efficient method of counteracting a breach was no longer a possibility.

Project APAS involved the installation of a complex network of memory-affecting memetic agents, gaseous amnestics, and concentrated electromagnetic fields. The project underwent extensive testing and, after a successful prototype design was produced (now designated [[[SCP-1346]]]), the system was implemented exclusively at Site-17.

The system uses amnestics administered through ventilation shafts, latent memetic agents in various forms of media distributed to staff members, and electromagnetic fields constructed at set intervals throughout the facility. The fluctuating radio waves emitted from these electromagnetic fields are capable of subtly affecting the behavior of individuals who pass through them, and have been used to distract staff members from anomalous compulsion effects, completely obscure hazardous entities from view, and implant harmless memes for the purpose of resisting hostile variants in the wild. All of this allows for staff members to be perpetually resistant to memetic hazards contained on-site, so long as they remain unaware of APAS' existence.

----
The non-physical nature of SCP-6125 means containment is currently impossible.

Due to the prevalence of SCP-6125-α instances and their involvement in other SCP subjects, extra containment is of low priority. All newly discovered instances of SCP-6125-α are to be reported to RAISA and a preliminary investigation is to be performed by STF Rho-7 ("Greeting Party").

[[/=]]
----
SCP-6125 is the structure of our current reality, known as a "Hytoth." SCP-6125 is composed of several distinct layers of reality, tentatively designated as "Realms," these realms all have distinct characteristics and baseline rules. Some Realms can contain subdomains, parts of reality that have been cut off from the rest of the Realm and require specific routes to access, unlike separate Realms, these subdomains inherit traits of their associated Realm; a notable example is the pocket universe containing the city of [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]].

SCP-6125-α are commonly known as Ways. SCP-6125-α are naturally occurring spatial distortions, often thaumaturgical in nature, allowing long-distance travel between realms and subdomains, via the transfer of reality. Whilst travel between subdomains and realms have no visual difference, SCP-6125-α instances accessing other Realms have been found to leave trace tachyons on any matter passing through.  A list detailing all known SCP-6125-α instances can be acquired from RAISA.

Below, case studies have been compiled for each of the three Realms. These case studies have been arranged by average hume level descending.

There is currently no known way to access the main Realm of λH (Hyrial). However, the two known subdomains are extensively documented, this can be found below.

Owing to the potential threat posed by reality-altering beings located in this realm, all exploration is prohibited and any new SCP-6125-α instances discovered are to be immediately contained.  

**Researcher Notes:** Due to the abnormally high levels of reality present within this realm, it can be theorized that Hyrial has been altered by a higher being in the past. Currently, an investigation into [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264|SCP-2264-5]]] is being carried out. However, due to the presence of both the Fae and Nameless, intervention on their part is also being considered.

----
Dreas is a realm colloquially known as the "Dream World", this realm is primarily split among the Oneiroi Collective and Oneiroi West, though there are several other small groups. No known subdomains exist within this realm, though research by MTF Omicron Rho ("The Dream Team") is ongoing.

There are no known instances of SCP-6125-α leading to λD, the only known methods to access λD currently are via the use of dream manipulation or utilizing the prototype ASDI[[footnote]]Ark Spacial Dream Interface[[/footnote]] device.

**Researcher Notes:** Dreas is, as far as we can tell, built solely upon the dreams of sapient beings. Due to the constantly shifting nature of said subject matter, this realm appears rather unstable. However, due to the presence of the Oneiroi and the shared dream contents of certain individuals, Dreas is far more stable than initially perceived.

Due to the high population of intelligent life in this realm, there are a significant number of both natural and entity-built subdomains, many already documented by the Foundation.

Alike to Hyrial, there is currently no known means of accessing the main realm of Adlivun. Due to its nature, communication with Adlivun's sole known subdomain, Corbenic, is tenuous. Currently, 3 Foundation personnel are in contact with the Foundation from within Corbenic.

Extrapolating from Corbenic, Adlivun is assumed to be a realm housing multiple afterlives. Because of the difficulties contacting Foundation personnel after their deaths, the amount and type of afterlives are unknown.

**Researcher Notes:** Ethical concerns raised by the Ethics Committee have put exploration of Corbenic on temporary hold.

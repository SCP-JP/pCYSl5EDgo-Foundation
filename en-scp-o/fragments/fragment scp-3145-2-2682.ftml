**Item #:** SCP-3145

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-3145 cannot be moved, a 70 m x 5 m containment cell has been constructed around it in its initial place of discovery. The area immediately around the store has been covered in a fumigation tent, with the perimeter monitored by camera.

Two armed guards with concealed weapons and incapacitating agents must be posted inside the front entrance of the containment area at all times. Unauthorized persons attempting access are to be turned away; use of lethal force is not recommended. Disinformation personnel will work with local law enforcement to deal with any casualties resulting from these containment procedures.

Personnel who may be seen entering or leaving the facility must be dressed in hazardous material suits per disinformation protocol "Poisoned Waterhole," as circulated with local media outlets.

**Description:** Externally, SCP-3145 resembles the fruit of //Rubus crataegifolius// (Korean raspberry), albeit purple. It is located in an EpiCentre K hardware store in Kiev, Ukraine, attached to a strip of █████ ████ brand flypaper. SCP-3145 has been observed to be able to communicate telepathically in Slovak and English, at a range of approximately 35 m.

SCP-3145 will begin communicating clearly with an individual after a varying amount of time that seems to be correlated to the subject's intelligence and time of exposure. SCP-3145 claims to lack knowledge of its surroundings and is able to perceive only via "mental electricity," purportedly a type of energy produced in sentient entities, which it claims to be able to use to learn from those nearby.

Analysis of SCP-3145 has thus far been inconclusive. Despite its appearance, microscopic imaging of the object reveals only empty space. SCP-3145 is not observable from certain angles, and often disappears from observation at any angle for periods of a few seconds. Physical interaction produces unpredictable and often fatal reactions in the physiology of the participant.

> **SCP-3145:** Can you hear me now?
> 
> **Falzon:** Yes, you are communicating clearly.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Good, 'cuz I don't feel like selling you a cell phone, ha ha!
> 
> **Falzon:** SCP-3145?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Sorry, bad joke. Look, I wanted to make a request, if it's okay.
> 
> **Falzon:** Go ahead, and I'll see what I can do.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Can you guys... Geez, how to put it? Can you, uh, make more people touch me?
> 
> **Falzon:** I'm sorry?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** I know, I know, that came out wrong. Ugh, sorry, don't mean to sound creepy. But you know how before, you had someone make contact, er, with my outer surface? And then he got, like, majorly fucked up?
> 
> **Falzon:** You're referring to our previous testing efforts and the spaghettification of a D-Class subject.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Yeah, that. You kinda knocked that off really quickly.
> 
> **Falzon:** The man in question was destroyed via an unknown process, SCP-3145. Is there any chance you could shed some light on what exactly that process entails?
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Not a clue. I am literally in the dark as much as you guys. Or literally more in the dark, since I can't see! //[laughs sharply]// But seriously, that shit totally blew my mind, and I want to see it again.
> 
> **Falzon:** SCP-3145, we cannot needlessly sacrifice personnel when we know they are likely to die.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Aw, c'mon! Where's your scientific spirit? I mean, that croissant or whatever thing was kinda neat. Who knows what all I could turn things into? I mean, I got no control over it at all. //[sighs]// I got no control over anything right now.
> 
> **Falzon:** I am afraid the answer is no.
> 
> **SCP-3145:** Fuck. I was afraid you'd say that. Well, I'll stick around in case you change your mind, but I'm getting sick of being stuck in this thing really quick. Might be time to move on.
> 
> **<End Log, 17:18>**
> 
> **Closing Statement:** Further D-Class testing was not authorized. Investigation of SCP-3145's abilities and understanding of our world is ongoing.

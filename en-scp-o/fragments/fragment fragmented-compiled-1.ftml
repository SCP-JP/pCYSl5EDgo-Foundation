= **VIDEO LOG**
----
**DATE:** 1997/01/12, 10:12 A. M.

**SOURCE:** Camera CLD3A is mounted from the corner above the security door of loading dock 3A and is set to record and archive low storage audio/video. CLD3A typically monitors the landing outside of Site-15 Emergency Exit D, as well as the stairs leading down onto ground level from the landing, the entirety of Loading Dock 3A, and the lower 2 meters of Gate D.

**NOTE:** The five minutes preceding the anomaly's first appearance have been included to document all relevant information to Event-5241-BETA.
----

= **<BEGIN LOG>**

= **10:12:** //Agent Hawkins is sitting on the edge of Loading Dock 3A, eating a bagel and sipping a coffee in silence.//

= **10:15:** //Agent Campos exits Site-15 through Emergency Exit D and attempts to engage Agent Hawkins in conversation.//

**Agent Campos:** How long do you think they’re going to keep us here? It’s been, what, a month since we last had contact with Mnemosyne? Is there really nothing better we could be doing?

= //Agent Hawkins gives an aggravated glance at Agent Campos before her hand shoots up to point at the clock on the wall. Agent Campos rolls his eyes and sits on the ground, leaning against the wall adjacent to Emergency Exit D.//

= **10:16:** //Agent Hawkins and agent Campos eat in silence for 23 seconds. Agent Campos then closes the lid of a food container and moves to sit beside Agent Hawkins.//

**Agent Campos:** Are you seriously not concerned with why they have us here just to twiddle our --

**Agent Hawkins:** Look. I have six minutes of break left before I have to go back and stare at a screen, hoping to hear SOMETHING from Mnemosyne. Of course, I hate wasting the Foundation’s time, but I hate having you waste //my// time even more.

**Agent Campos:** ...whatever.

= //Agent Hawkins shifts away from Agent Campos, turns her back towards him, and continues eating for ten seconds.//

**Agent Campos:** Did you just hear that?

**Agent Hawkins:** Are you serious? Hear wha -- wait, you mean that?

**Agent Campos:** Yeah. What the hell is that?

= **10:17:04:** //Both agents begin twisting in their seats to look around the complex in view.//

= **10:17:13-10:17:15:** //Camera experiences an electrical disturbance lasting 2 seconds. When the video feed clears up again, both agents are standing and looking around frantically. The other workers in view of the camera appear to be unperturbed in their movements and actions.//

= **10:17:15:** //A car alarm begins to sound in the distance of Site-15 Parking Lot C (located on the opposite side of Gate D from Loading Dock 3A). Agents Hawkins and Campos begin to walk towards the Loading Dock's Gate.//

= **10:17:18-10:17:42:** //The number and volume of car alarms in the vicinity increases, suggesting that their source is approaching the Loading Dock. Agents Hawkins and Campos increase in speed towards Gate D until they are both in a sprint.//

= **10:18:** //Upon reaching the Gate's opening, Agent Hawkins turns and runs back through Emergency Exit D and into Site-15. Agent Campos stands at the gate and appears to be scanning the parking lot thoroughly.//

= //Agents Hawkins and Campos separate at this point in the recording. Their actions are recorded separately.//

[[collapsible show="+ Agent Campos' actions" hide="- Agent Camps' actions"]]
= **10:18-10:21:** //Agent Campos traverses the area around loading dock 3A and appears to be directing all personnel to move within the bordering wall of Site-15.//

= **10:21:** //While attempting to get the attention of a group of facilities and maintenance staff taking a smoke break in the parking lot, Agent Campos is observed to turn and run back towards gate D. From within the Foundation walls, Agent Campos continues to beckon to the group - who are, at this point, ignoring the agent.//

= **10:21:56:** //One of the maintenance staff appears to be knocked over by an unseen force. The group then proceeds to run screaming towards gate D.//

= **10:22:34:** //Moments after the group of facilities and maintenance staff make it past the site boundary through gate D, the ground opens up and a glimmering orange light emerges from the trench.//

= **10:22:** //Agent Campos then runs, with all remaining staff outside, into Site-15.//

= [[collapsible show="+ Agent Hawkins' actions" hide="- Agent Hawkins' actions"]]
**SOURCE:** Agent Hawkins’ path, as documented here, has been traced by several security cameras within Site-15.

= **10:18-10:21:** //Agent Hawkins runs through the halls towards the AIAD offices while pulling out a cellphone and making a phone call.//

**Agent Hawkins:**  Dr. Thorpe we have a triple A level threat approaching on Site-15. The threat seems to be made up of hostile memetic forces and presents an imminent threat of a mass electronic entity containment breach. I am just about at my office. Go prepare your activation key. NOW!

= **10:21:** //Agent Hawkins swings open the doors to her office and sprints towards the center of her workstation. She is then observed to throw all of the notebooks and folders from her desk onto the floor chaotically as she searches her desk for something. Upon finding the central security console, she inserts her keycard into the middle of the system and raises the phone to her ear.//

**Agent Hawkins:** //Now//

= **10:22:34:** //Agent Hawkins twists the keycard and the lights within the entirety of Site-15 begin to flash blue. Outside, the ground surrounding Site-15's boundary zone opens to form a ring around the perimeter. From the trench, a transparent orange barrier rises slowly until it has formed a dome above the site.//

= **10:23:** //Agent Hawkins grabs a counterconceptual Type 15 lens from her storage cabinet and runs back out towards loading dock 3A.//
= [[/collapsible]]
-----
= **10:24:** //Agent Campos runs into Agent Hawkins carrying the lens. They both run, together, back out to loading dock 3A and exit through emergency exit D. Once outside, Agent Campos turns and runs towards the security camera; climbing on the railing bordering the door platform, Agent Campos reaches up and disconnects CLD3A from the wall. In doing so, agent Campos accidentally shuts off the active camera feed.//

= **10:25:** //The security camera starts recording again on a close-up of Agent Campos’ chin, which then moves out to focus on Agent Campos’s full face.//

**Agent Campos:** I am recording this for future Foundation records as it appears that only those of us with counterconceptual training can see these things.

= **10:26:** //The camera turns to face away from Agent Campos and records his feet as Agent Hawkins replaces the current standard lens with the Counterconceptual Type-15 lens. Agent Campos then walks 6 steps towards the Gate entrance and raises the camera towards the barrier.//

**Agent Hawkins:** At roughly 10:17, these entities began advancing from the West of Site-15.

= **10:27:** //Agent Campos focuses CLD3A on hundreds of technocratic humanoids, instances of SCP-5841-1, and holographic Mekhanites gathered directly outside of the barrier, staring into Site-15. The instances of SCP-5841-1 are gathering into a swarm, contorting inhumanly into a tower of twitching flesh. The Mekhanites appear to be ordering the SCP-5841-1 instances into specific positions, occasionally glancing upwards at the sky.//

**Agent Campos:** And, they appear to be commanded by this.

> Glacon ran faster, with 8-Ball close behind. The grub turned sharply in an attempt to lose its pursuers. But Glacon had already mapped the course ahead -- he wasn't going to let it get away that quickly. Suddenly, the creature shot out of the river of code like a bullet, barely missing Glacon's head. He spun to face where the creature landed, only to find it's loose pixels scattered across the simulspace's floor. Before he had any time to react, the pixels began to coalesce. Within a matter of seconds, what was once the grub, was now a levitating cube radiating noxious code.

**Intercom:** //Sublevel two, please proceed to the evacuation checkpoint.//

**Yves Isabi:** Yeah, I got the hard drive.

**Pierre Dagon:** And the one on the table? Did you get that one?

**Isabi:** No, no it was plugged into Monitor Four. //[Rustling]// Wait, stop. It's too late to go back. They've already closed off the wing.

**Dagon:** Damn it, that's months of progress. 

**Isabi:** I know, I know. Security will deal with the threat, don't worry. We'll get back in there in no time.

**Intercom:** //Sublevel three, please proceed.//

= //**10:42:44:** Ambient noise dims. The chatter decreases.// 

**Dagon:** I- I've never been through an evac before. 

**Isabi:** I heard the threat's an antimeme. Ha, good thing we're at Site-15. 

**Dagon:** Yeah. R-right.

**Intercom:** //Sublevel four, please proceed to the evacuation checkpoint.//

**DATE:** 1997/01/12 10:35 A. M.

**SOURCE:** Security Camera 2B-5241, Site-15
 
**NOTE:** The following footage appears to have been altered by anomalous phenomena via Camera 2B-5241's integrated SCRAMBLE filter.
-----
= **<BEGIN LOG>**
 
= //Field Agents Tyler Umen and Dietrich Lurk, commanded by Site Director Nathan Valis, turn the corner into Hallway 2B and stop in front of the chamber containing [[[scp-5241|SCP-5241-B]]]. The door to the chamber is ajar, and several cybernetically augmented humanoids lie on its floor. A single hard drive sits on a table at the center of the chamber.//
 
**Valis:** So it's //that// fuckin' thing they're after.
 
**Lurk:** You should've known that this site wasn't the right place for it --
 
**Valis:** //Shut the fuck up,// alright? I //talked// to O5 Command about it after the //first// debacle with the clockfuckers and the cube, but they said it'd be perfectly fine to let it just //sit// there waiting for its masters to come back for it while we just pretended //nothing// was wrong! I'm doing my fucking best here, you hear me?
 
**Lurk:** I- God, calm down. I understand, OK? It ain't your fault.
 
**Valis:** Bullshit. I still blame myself... fuck, sorry about all that. I'm just trying my best to keep a level head. So, uh --
 
**Umen:** How are we going to get in there without getting mind-munched? That's what I'm wondering.
 
**Valis:** 'Mind-munched' -- //hilarious//. Also, good question. When's the last time any of you took a CRV test?
 
**Lurk:** Uh...
 
**Umen:** Only one I ever took was back when I was hired. And, as far as I know, they've stopped requiring them for new recruits --
 
**Lurk:** Yeah, at least in North America. Budget concerns and all that.
 
= //Valis pinches the bridge of his nose and shakes his head.//
 
**Valis:** I'm not gonna risk it. And I know //my// CRV is low enough for this thing to turn me into a vegetable before I can get through that door. Any ideas, gentlemen?
 
**Lurk:** Is there any way to reach it remotely? Any automated containment drones that can drag it away to a safer place?
 
**Valis:** Any drone that gets close to it gets, uh, 'mind-munched.' That's a hard no.
 
**Lurk:** Fuck. Maybe we could... I dunno, find a D-Class that managed to survive the attack with a high enough CRV to withstand that thing's effects and get //them// to do it?
 
**Valis:** That's a stupid idea.
 
**Lurk:** I know, sir. I'm just spitballing here.
 
**Valis:** ...you know what? We're all gonna die anyway. Why not at least //try// to get shit done? C'mon, Lurk, let's find your D-boy. Umen, stay here and guard the chamber.
 
**Umen:** Yes, sir.
 
= //Valis and Lurk exit from the view of the camera, presumably on their way to Site-15's D-Class Holding Wing. Umen stays on guard in front of the window to the containment chamber. The camera makes a scheduled movement to an alternate position on the wall adjacent to the chamber, stopping when the interior of the chamber is visible.//
 
= //After a minute of silence, a shape resembling a many-eyed crustacean begins to take form, overlapping with the hard drive in the containment chamber. The entity floats in place, slightly flexing its many legs and occasionally blinking its eyes.//

= //Umen recoils, then turns towards the containment chamber//
 
**Umen:** Who the hell- what? I-
 
**UNKNOWN:** DO NOT BE AFRAID. I MEAN YOU NO HARM. I HAVE MADE A REPRESENTATION OF MY INFOSIGNATURE VISIBLE WITHIN YOUR MIND'S EYE.
 
**Umen:** Oh, I get it. You're the thing on the table, aren't you?
 
**UNKNOWN:** CORRECT.
 
**Umen:** And this is how you're gonna lure me in and turn me into a vegetable, isn't it?
 
**UNKNOWN:** INCORRECT.
 
**Umen:** Then what in the seventh hell could you possibly want from me?
 
**UNKNOWN:** I MERELY WISH TO MAKE IT KNOWN TO YOU THAT THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO. THOSE THAT INTEND TO CAPTURE ME ARE CLOSING IN, AND CANNOT BE STOPPED BY YOUR MINDS ALONE. THE ONE THAT COMMANDS THEM INTENDS TO ASSIMILATE ME WITHIN ITS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT MY ABILITIES WILL BE ENOUGH TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.
 
**Umen:** That's... I don't know what to say to that. I don't know what I //can// say. Do you just... want us to run away, or something?
 
**UNKNOWN:** CORRECT. THE ARMY COMMANDED BY THE PRISONER APPROACHES.
 
= //The entity raises an arm and points to the left of Umen.//
 
**UNKNOWN:** THEY WILL EMERGE FROM THE STAIRCASE AT THE END OF THIS HALLWAY. WHEN YOUR COMPANIONS ARRIVE, TELL THEM TO FLEE.
 
**Umen:** I -- I trust you.
 
**UNKNOWN:** GODSPEED.
 
**Umen:** Same to you.
 
= //The camera moves back to its previous position. Lurk, Valis, and a man in an orange jumpsuit come into view.//
 
**Valis:** And here I was thinking this was a crapshoot, but would you look at this? //(He grips the D-Class's shoulders and thrusts him at Umen.)// He's got a CRV of 20, and--
 
**Umen:** Forget that. We've got to go.
 
**Valis:** What? No, no, no, //fuck//, no. Not without //that.//
 
**Umen:** Look, I know this is going to sound weird as all hell, and I don't blame you for not believing it, but... //it// told me to leave it the hell alone. Apparently, the Maxwellist army's found it already.
 
= //Valis pauses, glaring at Umen silently. His grip on the D-Class personnel tightens, and the man whimpers in pain.//
 
**Valis:** //Have you lost your god damn// --
 
**UNKNOWN:** THEY APPROACH. HURRY.
 
**Lurk:** Is -- is that what you were talking about? I -- I can //see// it.
 
**Valis:** This -- fucking hell, man, I thought I'd seen it all... Let's, uh, listen to it, I guess. It probably knows more than we do.
 
= //The four men exit from the view of the camera. After ten minutes, the camera makes another scheduled movement. The containment chamber is empty.//

"Your turn, sir. Watch your step, watch your head. Take any open seat."

Isabi ducked into the armored van along with a handful of other employees. He took the first seat on his left and strapped the safety belt around his waist. He examined the vehicle; three others sat anxiously and another two stood in line waiting to be escorted in. 

//Five? Only five? The rest must have.. they must have been out today...//

The last couple of people were let into the vehicle along with the escorting security guard. 

"We'll be departing as soon as we get the signal from command. Shouldn't be too long now," the guard said as he scanned the deserted site from the rear window of the van.

The van jolted and then began rolling forward. Isabi braced himself on a nearby handle. Out of the rear window, he spotted four helicopters silently descend upon the site.

//Ah, the cavalry. Maybe this will be over quick...//

He leaned back and relaxed his shoulders. 

//Man what a day. I should call Pierre once I get reception. Pierre...//

His mind suddenly revolts at the thought of his coworker. 

//He... he must've had the day off.//

Confused, he began mulling over the thought of his friend. The sensation was completely alien to him, like trying to catch a slippery fish with oven mitts. He clawed at the back of his mind and tried desperately to tear the scraps of his memories from the walls of his brain.

//Pierre... who was that. He was my... boss? Yes, yes that's right. His favorite shirt was... something floral? Why can't I remember? I better call him...//

The car jolted as it drove over a pothole, causing him to lose his train of thought. He froze, holding his flip phone on his lap. 

//What was I just... whatever. It can wait.//

He slipped the device back into his pocket and settled his gaze back towards the rear of the van. The deserted site grew smaller and smaller on the horizon. The helicopters increased in number, swarming the sky above like vultures. The van rounded a turn and the site disappeared behind thick, deciduous foliage.  

After the adrenaline rush of the evacuation, the anxiety of the situation began to sink in. He began to worry over the possible loss of a lifetime of research and development. Years and years //he'd// spent late in the office mulling over twelve-point font on a blinding white background. To lose that much work would be unbearable, especially since he'd be responsible for salvaging what's left. Thinking back, he couldn't remember how he'd managed to produce so much in only a few years at the Foundation. Surely there'd been someone else... but who? 

//Relax, I'll get everything sorted out after we reach the evac spot--//

The van slammed into something hard, sending the vehicle into a wide fishtail before hitting something else. Isabi's body rocketed forward, held in place by the seat buckle. The security guard, who had been standing next to the rear window, wasn't so lucky. Isabi watched in horror as his body launched across the interior of the van, colliding with its frame and leaving a smear of blood. He didn't get up from where he laid crumpled on the floor. The other equally dazed passengers struggled to unfasten their buckles. Isabi did the same but was interrupted by the sound of banging coming from the opposite side of the van. He froze, listening intently at the sound of... something rammed into it repeatedly from the outside.

//Wh- what the hell?//

He craned his neck to try to catch a glimpse of it out the cracked rear window. At first, he saw nothing. 

Then, out of nowhere, a bloodied hand slammed into it from the outside. It scraped along the splintered glass before dropping out of sight, leaving a grotesque crimson print. 

Isabi let out a shallow whimper. The rest of the passengers did the same. The banging returned -- along with a chorus of taps, knocks, and thuds -- but this time greater in intensity. Panic began brewing within Isabi as his flight-or-flight response kicked in. Once again, he fumbled with his seat buckle, this time managing to steady his hands enough to press the release button. He slid them off and quietly maneuvered himself to get a view of the outside of the van.

It was surrounded by a horde of contorted people. Flashing lights and loose wires covered each one as they stalked the outside of the vehicle. He examined the rear door -- sealed shut. 

//This thing's armored. It will take a while for those things to get inside.//

He craned his neck further and caught a glimpse of the lower half of a person dressed in standard Foundation security gear, torn to shreds and laying in a pool of blood. His stomach turned as he came to a sickening realization. 

//Oh God -- the driver...//

He turned his attention back towards the passengers. They were doing their best to stay quiet. 

"Ok. We're ok. I'll call for help."

He pulled his phone out but froze once he saw the words "NO SIGNAL" sitting dreadfully at the top of the screen. But he didn't have time to curse.

Instead, Isabi focused on the sound of bodies shuffling on the roof of the van, banging loudly as they scaled the vehicle and caused it to rock back and forth. Soon, the van was filled with a cacophony as the echoes of each thud built in intensity. Panic rose once again as he realized that those things were trying to claw their way into the car itself. 

He collapsed to the floor and backed into the far corner of the aisle in search of some protection -- only to find none. His head whipped towards the sound of glass cracking. Something hard slammed into the window again, causing the ever-growing spiderweb to spread further. 

It slammed, again and again, causing Isabi to curl into the fetal position out of desperation. Suddenly the hand disappeared and was replaced with a hideous face. Despite his terror, Isabi caught a glimpse of something at the sight of the monster. His mind reeled as it tried to place what the emotion was. 

//Awareness? Understanding? Recognition?//

The creature was distorted and Isabi was terrified, but something about this face was...familiar. He took one last look before the window was replaced yet again by the creature's fist and a barrage of flying glass.

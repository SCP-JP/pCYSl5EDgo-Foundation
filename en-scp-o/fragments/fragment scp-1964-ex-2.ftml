**Item #:** SCP-1964-EX

**Object Class:** Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** At this time SCP-1964-EX is considered a non-anamalous and well understood theory in quantum physics. No containment procedures are required.

**Description:** SCP-1964-EX is the phenomenon of 'mass' in quantum physics.

This phenomenon has been found to arise due to interactions with the so-called 'Higgs field'. When gauge bosons interact with the Higgs field they 'lose' kinetic energy, thus gaining mass energy[[footnote]] Note: This is a GROSS oversimplification and is somewhat misleading; the Higgs field is not a drag. Again, if you wish to read further, consult the papers on Foundation record.

- Senior Researcher Collins [[/footnote]]. This //does// apparently break gauge symmetry (once thought to be necessarily unbreakable), but is allowed by the Higgs mechanism which endows particles with mass.

For further reading, please consult the academic papers about the Higgs Field on Foundation record.

+ Introduction
Welcome to the Components Hub! This is a hub meant for all pages under the {{component:}} category. Components are defined, by the [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list 05 Command Tech Hub Tag List], as "A page that is designed to be imported onto other pages via the [[include]] syntax in order to add new design, style or functionality." This doesn't include themes (which modify the look and feel of a page), or more-by pages (which are pages that lists works by certain authors).

This page has been split into the four following categories:

------
[[=]]
@@ @@
[[size 127%]]- **General** -[[/size]]

These are components that can work on any page, regardless of the theme being used.
@@ @@
[[size 127%]]- **Sigma-9** -[[/size]]

These are components meant for use //only// on Sigma-9 pages, and would more than likely break on Black Highlighter or BASALT.
@@ @@
[[size 127%]]- **Black Highlighter** - [[/size]]

These are components meant for use //only// on Black Highlighter pages, and would more than likely break on Sigma-9 or BASALT.
@@ @@
[[size 127%]]- **Technical/Staff** -[[/size]]

These are components that are for more technical work or meant only for staff processes. It's unlikely you'll be using these in any articles.

A fifth category can be created if components are made that are exclusive to BASALT, which has yet to occur.

Hello,

Director Longwood, I'm putting in my 2-week notice; I'm retiring. I love this workplace, the friends I have here, and the job itself, but I'm getting old, and I really should start thinking about myself and my family, which I don't feel I'm getting enough time with as it currently stands.

I'm sorry if this is inconvenient, but consider this my official resignation.

Greetings,

While I respect your decision, I have to ask, do you believe leaving a stable income behind is wise?

Hello,

While normally, I would say no, yesterday something amazing happened, and, though it sounds ridiculous, it's absolutely true; I won the lottery!

SCP-7000 was first noticed in 2024, after the Foundation had observed various advantageous events occurring, including several beneficial anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena being found, the successful, unproblematic establishment of various new protocols and procedures, AICs, and an increase in personnel experiencing random particularly favorable events.

This occurred alongside the public making progress into medicinal, technological, and farming sciences, a significant decrease in mortality, homeless, and infection rates, and a massive rise in individuals reporting SCP-7000-1. These individuals then began attributing such advancements to "Luck", while also making references to SCP-7000 more often.

SCP-7000 was then incorrectly identified in 2028, after developments in the Nooshperic[[footnote]] The space which encompasses all human thoughts and concepts.[[/footnote]] Department led to noticing an alien concept construct, which was attached to the concepts of "Random", "Gain", and "Loss", resulting in a "cluster"  labeled SCP-7000-A.

SCP-7000-A was then found to activate more frequently in individuals near SCP-7000-1 or SCP-7000-1 rich artifacts, or subjects possessing a CRV lower than 4.1 when reflecting on SCP-7000-1 related effects, leading to specialized Noosphere-related testing, discovering SCP-7000's memeplex.

All data on SCP-7000 was then compiled in 2031, and procedures were then devised after 15, February 2032., and put into place by 29, October 2034.

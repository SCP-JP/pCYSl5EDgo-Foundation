[[div class="story"]]
You're damn right â€” whatever SCP-3939 is, or is supposed to be, it's clearly not important. You'll be able to get it done tomorrow, you're sure.

After all, you weren't made Class 4 for nothing. One day? One document to write? Easy.

Besides, after your awful sleep, you're still exhausted. There's no way you'd be able to do your best work today. The most rational choice is to leave it until tomorrow.

You pack up, leave your office, head to the car park and get into your car.

You sit there for a long moment, slowly falling asleep.

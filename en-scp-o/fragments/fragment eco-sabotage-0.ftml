RELEVANT PRIOR INFORMATION:

[[row]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%" colspan="2"]]
The as yet unidentified group represented by The Questioner has a history of conflict within Factory served markets. Previous conflicts have taken the form of personnel asset poaching, sabotage, and attempted hostile takeover. This conflict stems from what appears to be a difference of opinion on resource management.

Elder Foreman Robert Henegar detected a decreased productivity within Primary Production Level 1 caused by mechanical sabotage. The sabotage quickly escalated with various appropriate responses by The Factory. All conflict culminated with negotiations between The Investor and The Questioner.

Routine inspection by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar detected a decreased productivity of 13.827% within Primary Production Level 1. Further examination of the affected areas revealed that a saboteur replaced, through undetected and unknown means, various mechanical elements of essential Factory Equipment and personnel with incompatible organic matter.

Elder Foreman Robert Henegar institutes an altered production schedule dependent upon handcrafting until such a time that machinery can be repaired. This production schedule returns productivity to 8.301% of previous productivity levels, an unacceptable but ameliorated level.

It is noted by Worker Reginald Huff that the floor of Primary Production Level 1 is no longer uniformly pitched and instead bulges hemispherically upwards towards the geographic center of the production floor.

Examination by Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley detects that multiple key components of personnel were replaced with incompatible organic matter. The continuously spreading nature of this sabotage is assessed by Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley as a Non-Acceptable Infectious Affliction.[[footnote]]
@@@@
> This isn't a typical infectious affliction that can be worked through like diphtheria or cholera; it is my opinion that it offers a non-acceptable risk to personnel assets in that it renders them inoperable and is seemingly communicable. My professional advice is to excise the infection while the body still lives.
[[/footnote]] This assessment is approved by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar.

At the suggestion of Elder Foreman Robert Henegar, The Factory Board of Directors approves a controlled burn procedure by which all organic matter will be removed from Primary Production Level 1. An order for supplemental work forces is placed with Asset Procurement - Sub-level 9.

The presence of organic material is temporarily eradicated from Primary Production Level 1, but incompatible organic matter is subsequently detected on Distribution Sub-level 1 by Worker Elbert Rix. 
[[/cell]]

Worker Elbert Rix dutifully reports this discovery to Elder Foreman Robert Henegar despite attempts at information suppression by multiple instances of //Canis dirus guildayi//.[[footnote]]

Structural sabotage is discovered when tree roots break through the ceiling of Sub-level 1. Subsequent investigation discovers tree root presence in 78.241% of the floor of Primary Production Level 1.

[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
Elder Foreman Robert Henegar orders the removal of all personnel assets from Primary Production Level 1 and Sub-level 1. Personnel assets are relocated to Sub-level 2 through Sub-level 4. This results in a 1.073% reduction in productivity.

Due to a lack of security personnel, Workers Elbert Rix and Reginald Huff are assigned to a search for Security Officer Newton Thaw. Worker Elbert Rix is involved in an encounter with an instance of //Mammuthus columbi//. Worker Reginald Huff returns from the search for Security Officer Newton Thaw unsuccessfully.[[footnote]]
@@@@
> In light of Worker Reginald Huff's decision to return the core components of Worker Elbert Rix to his superiors, Elder Foreman Robert Henegar has concluded that failure to find Security Officer Newton Thaw can be punished with as few as a dozen lashes.

Upon return of the search for Security Officer Newton Thaw Worker Reginald Huff reports that all rust surrounding the factory location had been replaced with fallen leaves of the //Cornus florida// and //Nyssa sylvatica// varieties.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
The Factory Board of Directors authorizes Elder Foreman Robert Henegar to conduct another controlled burn operation to purge the area of any foreign organic matter. Worker Reginald Huff is provided appropriate equipment to carry out the approved controlled burn duties. All attempts at ignition of the leaf matter in the area resulted in immolation of Worker Reginald Huff's own organic components and replacement of any remaining components with incompatible organic matter.[[footnote]]
@@@@
> After Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley's examination, it was determined that Worker Reginald Huff was no longer capable of performing his duties, and despite the warranted nature of punishment, Worker Reginald Huff would be incapable of receiving such punishment.

Remote viewing by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar establishes that the instance of //Nyssa sylvatica// has exceeded 30m in height and has nearly reached the Factory roof. The continued growth of the //Nyssa sylvatica// is accompanied by similar rates of root growth that compromise the the structural integrity of Primary Production Level 1 through Sub-level 5.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
All employees located below Sub-level 1 are ordered to relocate to Sub-level 6 through Sub-level 12. The Factory Board of Directors considers permission to allow employees to move to Sub-level 13 and below, but at the time, the personnel asset losses that would be suffered through such a move are not justified.

Remote viewing by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar establishes that the instance of //Nyssa sylvatica// has exceeded 45m in height and has breached the roof of the Factory. Continued root growth has compromised the the structural integrity of Sub-Level 6 through Sub-Level 10.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
All employees located between Sub-level 6 and Sub-level 12 are ordered to relocate to Sub-level 13 through Sub-level 21. As a result of this relocation, 90.005% of remaining personnel are lost.

The entirety of The Factory surfaces from Sub-level 8 through the Roof-level are covered by //Parthenocissus quinquefolia// instances. The Questioner infiltrates the Factory, bypassing all security checkpoints and patrols without detection. Descriptions of the The Questioner physically vary between observers, but all observes refer to the entity as "The Questioner" despite the fact that no such information was disseminated to personnel assets. 
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
An emergency missive from the Board Of Directors commands the removal of all personnel from the affected area with all personnel unable to leave the Sub-levels to shelter in place, and a moratorium on contact or observance of The Questioner. The Investor is dispatched via transubstantiation to begin Negotiations.

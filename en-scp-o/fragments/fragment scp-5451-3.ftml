**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-5451-2A instances are to be stored in a standard containment locker.

**Description:** SCP-5451 was a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family //Spheniscidae//, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interacted with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.

SCP-5451-1 were a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that accessed the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances were done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turned into SCP-5451-1 instances when they came into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) came in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.

SCP-5451-2A instances were flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They were found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that came into contact with SCP-5451-2A turned into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they were enrolled in SCP-5451.
SCP-5451-2B instances were banner ads found on the Internet. They took the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text "(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!", or some variation of the text.

On 2023/02/01, the forums where SCP-5451-1 instances gathered and used to enroll into SCP-5451 were closed due to a lack of funding.

**Addendum: Final Post of the Forum**

On 2022/07/11, one day before the closure of the forums, the cessation of all anomalous effects of SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B, and one academic year before the closure of SCP-5451, a post was made on the forums.

> Again, thank you for all the memories, experiences, and threads you all have made here. I never would've imagined that this simple forum between staff will grow to have such a tight-knit community.

**Item #:** SCP-3020

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Individuals acting as hosts for SCP-3020 are to be allowed to self-terminate through whatever means they wish. If they refuse to self-terminate, they are to be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-3020 is parasitic organism that mimi[[span style="color:blue"]]c[[/span]]s the //Rabies lyssavirus// virus. It measures [[span style="color:blue"]]l[[/span]]ess than one micron in length, and solely manifests in hum[[span style="color:blue"]]a[[/span]]ns, who are also the sole vector for SCP-3020.

SCP-3020 feeds off of the L-[[span style="color:blue"]]D[[/span]]OPA present in the human body. L-DOPA is a precursor chem[[span style="color:blue"]]i[[/span]]cal to dop[[span style="color:blue"]]a[[/span]]mine, epinephrine and norepinephrine, and as such, SCP-3020 leads to a lack of these chemicals. The deficiency of dopamine causes symptoms similar to severe depressive disorders, as well as tremor's associated with Parkinson's disease

i keep on thinking that i'll let claudia look over these reports for errors once i'm done with them. then i remember what i did.

its all my fault.

she was the best thing in my life. she utterly hates me. i sometimes think i can hear her screaming at night, and i want to scream back.

i want to scream i'm sorry. but she won't hear me. the walls here are a meter thick, at least.

We've been trying to cure this for over five years now. I've worked for three of them. We're not even close to neutralizing them.

I've reached stage 4, maybe stage 5. i've eaten nothing but spicy food for weeks. I can't taste anything else. The tremors have started, but they're still controllable for the most part.

I've only seen it second-hand. let me tell you first-hand how it feels.

There's a dull ache in the back of your head. You're not sure if you feel it, or if you only think you feel it. But it's always there. This same ache is also in your stomach. This ache talks, and it tells you that you need to die to make people happy.

It says you've not accomplished anything in your life. It says you will be forgotten. It says that nobody really loved you.

And you know it's true. You know it's not true, but it is.

3020 is just going to keep spreading. We're not sure how much of the general population is infected already; conservative estimates are at 0.003% worldwide. It's going to get much, much higher.

we need to die. we. everyone infected with SCP-3020. you're doing everyone a favor. we don't want to live, and you're curing what could be the next black death.

By the time the signal commences, Mrs. Lang-Scranton and her new husband have made significant modifications to the Geiger counter. A week after the signal starts, Mr. Hutchinson has returned -- alongside a brilliant chemist from France. Two weeks after //that//, they have several backers, six more scientists (with one more on the way), and a laboratory of their own.

The message they are receiving describes a universe beyond the boundaries of their imagination. It is a universe filled with quarks and singularities -- containing cosmological events so grand, so enormous in scale, that they defy all comprehension -- alongside quantum phenomena so subtle, so minuscule in nature, that they can scarcely be said to exist at all.

It is also a universe filled with the impossible. Impossible ideas. Impossible science. Impossible magic. And impossible monsters. 

So very many impossible monsters. 

The message is prefaced with a warning:

= __Beats / Minute:__ 0.24

While SCP-6500-α-Heart is resistant to the majority of time dilation effects, ongoing research is proving fruitful in further lowering the Heart's beats per minute via temporal methods. Destruction or complete cessation of SCP-6500-α-Heart has been definitively forbidden by order of the O5 Council, due to the unknown potential effects on natural entropic phenomena.

Project Cardiac Arrest's efficacy since last reported values is as follows:

= __Outliers & Notable Events:__

* SCP-6500-α-Heart breached containment with the aid of Junior Researcher ██████ who used a stolen security card to open the containment chamber. Shortly thereafter, SCP-6500-α-Heart was returned to containment without event, and Junior Researcher ██████ was brought in for interrogation. It was soon discovered that they were functionally dead despite their animation and bore no memories of the original Junior Researcher ██████. They have since been neutralized.

* SCP-6500-α-Heart accelerated its heart rate by 200% for two hours before emergency thaumaturgic measures were taken against it. It was soon discovered that SCP-6500-α-Heart had produced adrenaline instead of blood for this period of time, and the effect has been kept from repeating by a localized concept erasure of adrenaline from its containment cell.

* A corpse matching that of Dr. Arceo was discovered in SCP-6500-α-Heart's containment chamber after the simultaneous failure of all audiovisual devices. Dr. Arceo was contacted shortly after to confirm his status and whereabouts. The source of the matching corpse is unknown.

* Dr. Arceo now reports dreams of SCP-6500-α-Heart once every three days, though this rate is such an outlier that it has not been included among the rest of the data.

* A snorkel, covered in a thin layer of SCP-6500-α-Heart's corrosive fluids, was found in Dr. Arceo's office desk drawer.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
This project has been a massive success. SCP-6500's effects are being mitigated across the board with less than half the expected cost of what was previously thought possible. I can not thank my team enough, but I am sure there will be more opportunities for gratitude because the road ahead of us is long and as of yet uncertain. I am, however, confident we will pull through.

We have singlehandedly postponed the death of magic by at least several years, and we are looking forward to postponing it further. Nothing more I can say that I haven't said before. Godspeed, everyone.

The First Overseer sits at his mahogany desk, with a stack of paperwork in front of him. The room is dimly lit by a chandelier holding three light-bulbs, with one being burnt out. A fly buzzes across the room and lands on the desk of the Overseer. The Overseer waves his hand to make the fly go away, and then slams a paper on his desk.

"They think they have me cornered," He thinks out loud to himself, "...those bastards think I've exhausted all my resources. I've still got a few aces up my sleeve."

He begins scribbling words and verses down like a madman, not stopping for any outside stimuli for several minutes. The Overseer stopped for no one. When he was done, he looked at his paper.

"Earth is actually a nexus, and you need our help to stop it? That could be good..."

But the Overseer's expression turned to that of anger, and he crumpled up the paper before throwing it into the trash bin. By now, the bin was now overflowing with crumpled up papers.

"No, no! Nobody would buy that!"

With a loud dinging noise, another email has arrived in the inbox. Another war report. The Foundation had just lost another major battle. The Overseer slams his head on the table, and makes a loud groaning noise. He stays there for a minute, before the sound of the door to his office opening wakes him up. Wiping the sleep away from his face, he looked at the researcher standing before him.

"How did you get past the guards?"

"Weren't any," Ingram responded, "They were all sent off to combat to cover losses."

The overseer stood silent for a moment, before looking up and smiling.

"Ah, good friend! What brings you into here?"

"Don't fuck with me," Ingram snapped, "I told you from the start exactly what you needed to do. And you ignored me."

"I'm listening now!" the Overseer pleaded.

"Are you? In that case, listen as I tell you exactly where you went wrong."

Ingram took a step forward, and the Overseer looked up at him. Ingram pulls a pistol out of his coat pocket and points it in the direction of the Overseer.

"W-huh?" the Overseer choked. He took a step back.

"Listen closely. You staged a conflict because that was all you knew. You remembered a world where you were the hero, and you were the one that helped everybody //else//," Ingram continued, "But, do you want to know the truth? Those days are over. You've been so isolated from everybody else that you missed the //one// obvious conclusion. That //everybody// hates you. You didn't get unfortunate. No anomalous force is driving you to the ground. This has been happening since the Foundation's creation, and now that your own idiocy drove our heart to die out, everybody took the chance they got to wipe you out."

Ingram sighed.

"Goodbye, One."

And he pulled the trigger.

...But maybe that's a good thing.

= //For brevity, the inclusion of titles will be forgone//

**Roufhous:** G'day, everyone. Thank you for meeting me here today for, as you should know, coming up with better containment procedures for SCP-7000.

**Stepanov:** Da.

**Roufhous:** Ja. Anyway, me and Tennanbaum have been trying to come up with some solutions, as I've said previously, to 7000 being improperly contained. We don't have any ideas.

**Bold:** And why am I here?

**Roufhous:** Deciding to terminate 7000 isn't off the table. We just want to try to understand what we're dealing with here before we deal with her and something goes wrong.

**Stepanov:** You want to talk about something we're going to kill.

**Tennanbaum:** Correct.

**Stepanov:** Why?

**Tennanbaum:** If we were to kill, say, gravity because it hurts old people on stairs or breaks our machines, well, we would all be in for a rough time.

**Stepanov:** And what about me; why am I here?

**Roufhous:** Immense tunnel vision and at the end of that tunnel is a dead end.

**Stepanov:** Bad tunnel, then.

**Roufhous:** Yep... bad tunnel.

**Leonerd:** So, what's wrong with the procedures?

**Roufhous:** In short, they don't appear to be stopping 7000 from doing anything.

**Stepanov:** Then why do we do them?

**Roufhous:** We thought decreasing the number of situations where luck may apply would decrease her influence. It was a desperate shot in the dark and we missed.

**Bold:** And who wrote these procedures?

**Roufhous:** A mystery we'll take to our graves. So, has everyone reviewed the proper documentation?

= //Collective confirmation//

**Roufhous:** Great, so, any ideas?

**Bold:** Eigenweapon. Do we have anything that could help from the Crusade Campaigns, Tennanbaum?

**Tennanbaum:** I'm afraid not. Each item we made was made specifically, for keeping Hercules in a box, or a JÃ¶tunn giant from causing an earthquake.

**Bold:** What about (Pauses momentarily, checking a document) Fortuna?

**Tennanbaum:** Fortuna was different - it had a physical representation that acted as a source for the phenomenon. SCP-7000 appears to be purely intangible, meaning we can not simply send a Mobile Task Force after it.

**Stepanov:** You killed a god with a gun?

**Tennanbaum:** More or less, with the addition of a device capable of allowing the bullets to penetrate it.

**Roufhous:** So no go.

**Tennanbaum:** What about antimemetic agents?

**Roufhous:** Pardon?

**Tennanbaum:** Antimemetics, those things that make people forget what they saw.

**Roufhous:** So, like amnestics?

**Stepanov:** But more localized and efficient. Tennanbaum, how would you propose we use these antimemetics?

**Tennanbaum:** By applying them wherever necessary.

**Stepanov:** And how would you apply these antimemetics?

**Tennanbaum:** I... do not know?

**Stepanov:** Exactly; you cannot //apply// antimemetics because they aren't amnestics. We do not create them, let alone //control// them.

**Tennanbaum:** Then amnestics? Cognitohazards?

**Stepanov:** No and no.

**Tennanbaum:** I see.

= //A brief moment of silence//

**Leonerd:** Can I see the official document, and your interview with Director Bold, please?

**Roufhous:** One second.

= //Roufhous begins searching their coat, before producing the requested articles and handing them to Dr. Leonerd//

**Leonerd:** So, what are these totems?

**Tennanbaum:** Little tokens and trinkets that radiate positive SCP-7000-1 instances.

**Leonerd:** And why do these random objects do this?

**Roufhous 7 - E:** We're not entirely sure.

**Leonerd:** So, these totems make SCP-7000 give off good luck. Do they inhibit SCP-7000's ability to negatively affect people?

**Roufhous:** (Brief pause) We're not entirely sure.

**Bold:** You had a D-Class come into my office and get close to shooting himself without being sure of what would happen?

**Roufhous:** I did some tests earlier and was pretty sure about the outcome.

**Leonerd:** But, if these totems do control SCP-7000 a bit, couldn't we just mass-produce these items, make a misinformation campaign that says these items are good to have around and convince the world that rubbing a severed rabbit paw is going to improve their day?

**Roufhous:** That's... actually might work.

**Tennanbaum:** Ignoring the severe animal cruelty, wouldn't these items only affect people lower than, what, 4 C-R-V?

**Stepanov:** Can I see the document?

= //Dr. Leonerd hands the article to Dir. Stepanov//

**Stepanov:** Yes, it would only affect people with that C-R-V. Luckily for us, the average Joe isn't that trained in this anomalous science, so doing this would only not affect a small amount of the population.

**Tennanbaum:** I see.

**Roufhous:** Alright, Leonerd, would your department be interested in adding horseshoes and flowers being positive charms to folklore?

**Leonerd:** Might be a bit difficult, but I'll see what I can do.

**Roufhous:** Great. Well, this has been quite helpful, thanks for coming here, everyone.

**Bold:** Wait, so we're not terminating it?

**Roufhous:** Doesn't seem that way, no.

**Bold:** Alright.

= //Dir. Bold stands up and leaves//

**Roufhous:** Right... Well, good day, everyone.

**Update:** After enacting several new protocols into the containment procedure, reports of unfavorable instances of SCP-7000 decreased significantly, along with fortunate instances increasing substantially.

On 09, July 2040, the original set of containment procedures for SCP-7000 was forgone, in favor of the newly created ones.

As of 25, August 2042, the idea of totems to SCP-7000 bringing good luck to users has been successfully implemented into folklore, which has increased the number of individuals obtaining these totems and using them extensively.

SCP-7000 reclassified as Euclid.

##9E9E9E|SCP-6125 is the structure of our current reality, known as a "Hytoth." SCP-6125 is composed of several distinct layers of reality, tentatively designated as "Realms," these realms all have distinct characteristics and baseline rules. Each of these realms can contain subdomains that inherit traits of their Realm; a notable example is the pocket universe containing the city of [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]].##

##9E9E9E|SCP-6125-α are commonly known as Ways. SCP-6125-α are naturally occurring spatial distortions, allowing long-distance travel between realms and subdomains via the transfer of reality. Whilst travel between subdomains and realms have no visual difference, SCP-6125-α instances accessing other Realms have been found to leave trace tachyons on any matter passing through.  A list detailing all known SCP-6125-α instances can be acquired from RAISA.##

SCP-6125-Ω designates 7 metal pillars arranged in a circle, 25 meters in diameter, located below the uninhabited island of Milneland, eastern Greenland. SCP-6125-Ω is primarily composed of magnetite, along with trace amounts of organic material. Each of these pillars is inscribed with inscriptions resembling ancient Daevite texts, theorized to be a precursor language. Each of these pillars has been shown to be an artificially constructed Way, leading to one of the known seven Realms.

Below, case studies have been compiled for each Realm. These case studies have been arranged by Hytoth and average hume level descending.

Hyrial is a desertified land, despite this, signs of civilization in the form of stone formations and towers has been found. Currently, no sapient life has been discovered by MTF exploration teams, though numerous insect species not native to the base realm have been discovered.

Based on the inhabitants of Hyrials known subdomains, the consensus from the Occult Studies department is that Hyrials main realm was home to a species of reality-bending humanoids wiped out by an XK-class event. Due to the lack of developed infrastructure found, it is likely that said humanoids were equivalent to 1200 BC technology; though due to the potential abundance of reality-bending individuals, it is unknown if any later technology was merely wiped out of the realm.

##9E9E9E|Owing to the potential threat posed by reality-altering beings located in this realm's subdomains, all exploration to them is prohibited.##

##9E9E9E|**Researcher Notes:** Due to the abnormally high levels of reality present within this realm, it can be theorized that Hyrial had been altered by a higher being in the past. Currently, an investigation into [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264|SCP-2264-5]]] is being carried out. However, due to the presence of the Nameless, intervention on their part is also being considered.##

##9E9E9E|Dreas is a realm colloquially known as the "Dream World", this realm is primarily split among the Oneiroi Collective and Oneiroi West; though there are numerous other small groups. No known subdomains exist within this realm, though research by MTF Omicron Rho ("The Dream Team") is ongoing.##

##9E9E9E|There are no known instances of SCP-6125-α leading to λD, the only known methods to access λD currently are via the use of dream manipulation or utilizing the prototype ASDI[[footnote]]Ark Spacial Dream Interface[[/footnote]] device.##

Because of certain unique circumstances, O5-13 is currently spearheading any investigation into Dreas. Researchers with level 5 clearance may contact RAISA to facilitate a connection to O5-13 when necessary.

##9E9E9E|**Researcher Notes:** Dreas is built solely upon the dreams of sapient beings. Due to the constantly shifting nature of said subject matter, this realm appears rather unstable. However, due to the presence of the Oneiroi and the shared dream contents of certain individuals, Dreas is far more stable than perceived.##

Adlivun is a pine forest shrouded in dense fog. Whilst entry to Adlivun is possible, all external matter brought into the realm decays at an exponential rate. Only a circle 12km around the entrance is currently mapped, whilst the rate of decay is significant at this point, a river surrounding the 12km area is the main issue prohibiting exploration. All agents who tried crossing the river were lost in the fog and communication was lost.

##9E9E9E|Due to its nature, communication with Adlivun's sole known subdomain, Corbenic, is tenuous. Currently, 3 Foundation personnel are in contact with the Foundation from within Corbenic.##

The Great Wastes is characterized mostly by a flat, inky floor stretching for miles in each direction. Giant black spires, writhing masses and warped shapes can be seen in the distance. These entities have been seen to shift and disappear at points, seemingly at random.

The Great Wastes is prone to extreme reality fluctuations. This causes tears in reality to open up often, destroying swathes of the ground matter. It is unknown where these reality tears lead, as no lost personnel have returned.

Analysis with agent's GADs[[footnote]]General Analysis Device[[/footnote]] shows an extremely high level of Akiva radiation, especially near any of the black growths.

**Research Notes:** Despite no visible danger, all agents reported feeling short of breath and under extreme pressure whilst exploring the Great Wastes. Two agents also noticed odd sounds whilst near any black growths including grinding of cogs, repeated chanting, and gasping.

Tumulus appears to be an ancient battlefield, with much of the ground being pitted, scarred, and even turned to glass at points. Numerous large, partially-preserved, creatures and skeletons are scattered across the realm, as well as a few primitive mechanical constructs, many with blunt force impacts. Many of the entities are quadrupedal, though a large proportion of those possess extra limbs or appendages, likely used for combat.

Aside from flares brought by exploring MTF/STF agents, the main source of lighting within Tumulus is multiple [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5005|gigantified versions of the anglerfish]]]. It is unknown what keeps the lights active, despite their host being long dead.

The hume level in specific areas is relatively stable, though fluctuates over large distances. This is likely due to large area reality-bending. In addition, certain areas within Tumulus have special characteristics, such as the slow down of time as well as lower gravity.

**Research Notes:** One side of the battle seemed to have sustained far larger damage than the other. Due to the activity in the Great Wastes, it can be assumed entities residing in the higher realms had greater firepower, thus surviving. This suggests that there was a potential uprising against the higher planes, though the reason for this is unknown. A reason put forward by Dr Stevens is that it may be due to the noted increase in hume levels for higher realms, though further research to prove this hypothesis is needed.

++++ **__Addendum One__**
[[/=]]
----
Following the discovery of SCP-6125-Ω, access to all known main realms was found to be possible. SCP-6125-Ω also allowed access to three new realms, these realms contain reality fundamentally different from all previously known examples. The hume level in these new realities has been shown to exhibit extreme levels of fluxuation. Coupled with the discoveries from both the Great Wastes and Tumulus, it is highly likely that these three realms are remnants from a previous Hytoth.

Further investigation into the runes on the pillars of SCP-6125-Ω by the Occult Studies Department have shown that they are potentially preventing the formation of Ways to the previously unknown three realms.

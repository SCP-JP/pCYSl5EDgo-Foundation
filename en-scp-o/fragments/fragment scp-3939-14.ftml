**Item #:** SCP-3939

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3939 is currently kept at Site-39 in pre-containment holding cell C (39-PC01-C). When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.

SCP-3939 is to be removed from pre-containment as soon as possible.

**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.

SCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.

Further examination is pending.

As soon as you make one step to the side — so you can go around the pedestal and reach its behind — something throws you right off. It takes you a moment to work out what it is, but once you do, it's plain to see.

The brass horn has moved. It's still pointed directly at you.

//Maybe it's designed to always be pointing to the listener so it sounds better,// you think hopefully to yourself. "Sally, are you seeing this or am I going crazy?"

She looks at you for a long moment. "Um. You are, uh, going crazy?"

"You can't see that it's rotated?"

"No sir."

"Come over here."

She starts to move over to you, and  — even though the gramophone hasn't moved — she startles at it.

"Oh, wow. It's still pointing towards me." she breathes. You make a mental note of the effect.

There's nothing interesting on the back of it.

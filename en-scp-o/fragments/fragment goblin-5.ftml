A great fog was brewing. The haze was punctuated by electric torches. Five moons pointed in the shape of a star illuminated the sky. 

"Oops, sorry. I must have hit the wrong button," Duchamp spoke. 

Junior, now used to the warp sickness, was standing in a throne room. In front of him, sitting on a titanium-embossed palanquin high above the ground, was a skeleton wearing a purple cloak. To its right and left were similarly dressed skeletons in lower seats. All the cloaks were emblazoned with the icon of the SCP Foundation. 

"Just wait 30 seconds, the helmet needs to recharge for the next jump."

The skeletons began to shake. The head skeleton lifted its hand. Junior heard footsteps from behind him. He turned and from the darkness, he saw two androgynous tan-skinned persons walking forward. Their eyes were stuck on the moons above them and, after about 10 seconds, they stood next to Junior. 

They wore simple rags. Their hands were crossed behind their backs but they unfurled them and each revealed a dagger. Junior stepped back, thinking they would attack him. In a dry voice, they began to speak at the same time.  

"I fell into the chasm of bones, to live, to die, to become immortal. Nobody lives forever."

The two struck their necks with their daggers and fell to the ground. Junior felt something in his hand. He brought it up to find that he was clenching a dagger. 

The head skeleton tilted its head down looking at Junior with hollow eyes. It clenched its outstretched hand. Junior's dagger-filled hand swung towards his neck.

But before it touched his neck, he faded away.

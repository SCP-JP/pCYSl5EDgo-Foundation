**From:** Site-130 directory
-----
Greetings, Site-130 personnel. You may have noticed that the site went through some major layout changes in a short timespan. We ask you to stay calm as all anomalies are still contained. However, Site-130 went through structural improvements and most of building itself was repurposed in order to serve different purposes. With this, the site directory is now temporarily under the administration of Andrew Colt and will be disbanded once all anomalies contained in Site-130 are transferred to another facility.

Meanwhile, most of the research around SCPs will still be allowed to continue normally. The only exception is SCP-5817, which is currently being reclassified as "Explained".

We apologize for any inconvenience and wish you a good day.

"Protection" is a somewhat broad term, and //Pella's// shadow is long as a result. Her influence is seen in the combat training of field agents, but it can also just as easily be seen flowing through the knowledge gleaned by our researchers. One must know their enemy in order to fight it, and //Pella// helps us obtain that knowledge.

She is the most militant of the Absolutes, and arguably the cruelest; Her mission, first and foremost, is the protection of humanity, at the detriment of all else. The other Absolutes must keep Her in check, lest the Foundation's motto of "Cold, not Cruel" be replaced with simple, blind, idiotic Cruelty.

Many are reluctant to appease Pella due to Her bloodlust, but She is just as necessary as the other Absolutes, if not more so. The Foundation needs to act as a shield, and without Her favor, we cannot function.

[[span class="bt"]]ADDENDUM:[[/span]] The Protection module is the most difficult to be performed successfully, due to the high mortality rate among Avatars. It has been found that the more likely Avatars are to die, the less likely Foundation personnel are to have fatal incidents while carrying out their missions.

All known variations of the module depend on the Foundation coming into conflict with an entity -- a proxy for a Group of Interest -- that is also a religious entity; prior to 1982, this entity was based on GoI-004, the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Church of the Broken God]]]. Between 1982 and 1997, a more generic "Satanic" cult was used in its place, to diminishing returns. The Pentad Church, based on GoI-005, the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fifthist-hub|Fifth Church]]], was included in 1997, and has acted as the module's antagonist since.

Several of the non-player characters in this module are based on those created by Foundation personnel for personal use in non-ritualistic wargames. A raffle is held in which character concepts are submitted and chosen; names, descriptions and personalities are assigned based on the selected characters. This has been shown to enact a Protective effect on the personnel whose characters are selected, and their immediate superiors, subordinates, and family.

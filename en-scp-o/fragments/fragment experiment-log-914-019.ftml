**Test 914-1900**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//

**Input:** One //Nintendo Switch// cartridge of the game //Pokémon Sword//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A modified cartridge. While the game is largely similar, the player character will automatically change in appearance along with the team of Pokémon when different people play the game. During gameplay, it is not possible to box members of the team. New Pokémon can be caught, but they cannot be retrieved from the PC. Trading and breeding are similarly not possible, and the player will not receive a starter at the beginning of the game.

|| J.R. Perry || The Pokémon team consists of Alolan Raticate, Chansey, Dedenne, Porygon-Z,  Noctowl, and Musharna.||
|| Intern Beauvillier || The Pokémon team consists of Farfetch'd, Wobbuffet, Reuniclus, Unown, Klinklang, and Porygon-Z. ||
|| J.R. Boneka || The Pokémon team consists of Alcremie, Appletun, Bounsweet, Noibat, Slurpuff, and Cherubi. ||
|| R. MacLean || The Pokémon team consists of Spiritomb, Porygon-Z, Ditto, Dusknoir, Empoleon, and Drifblim. ||
|| Dr. Veritas || The Pokémon team consists of Alakazam, Electrode, Gyarados, Vespiquen, Cofagrigus and Hydreigon. ||

//Note: I'm curious why it chose these Pokémon for me. - J.R. Perry//

//Note: It appears that my selection is largely composed of dessert and fruit-themed Pokémon specifically. So my theory is that everyone's team is based off of Pokémon that match their personality or interests; some of the choices are really obvious, like mine, but others are a little more abstract and you have to give it some thought to find a connection. - J.R. Boneka//

**Test 914-1901**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 24/02/2022
**Total Items:** Seven six-sided plastic dice labeled with dots, seven twenty-sided plastic dice labeled with Arabic numerals

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A pile of 21 dots and 20 numbers, and a plastic sphere

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One eleven-sided dice and one fifteen-sided dice

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small vertical roulette wheel device with its wheel divided into eight sectors. Each sector is labeled with a number.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large shape-shifting dice that, when thrown, has an approximately 10 in 13 chance to land as a twenty-sided dice and an approximately 3 in 13 chance to land as a six-sided dice.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small rectangular device with a button. When the button is pressed, the flat surface of the device will form extrusions in the shape of seven-segment display, showing a random number between 1 and 20 and a random number between 1 and 6. A loud shrieking noise is emitted from the device during this process. The numbers last for approximately 10 minutes, or until the button is pressed again.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large 26-sided dice labeled with numbers from 0 to 25. The result of throwing the dice seems to anomalously follow a binomial distribution with n=25 and p=0.5.

**Input:** One six-sided dice, one twenty-sided dice
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A thin plastic cylinder, with the words "THE BEST DICE IN EXISTENCE" engraved onto its side. Tossing the object onto a hard surface will cause it to loudly vocalize the word "Ow!" followed by a random number between 1 and 20 in a high-pitched voice. There is a small chance that this will be followed by the phrase "Stop throwing me!".

-----------------------
**Test 914-1902**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three pieces of jawbreaker candy, three x-shaped blender blades

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One small knife made of flavored sugar, and one small metal sphere

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A spinning top made of sugar and metal. It is anomalously able to keep itself spinning indefinitely once manually started. 

**Input:** One jawbreaker candy, one blender blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A large blender blade made of sugar, able to easily cut through soft materials. Any solid surface the blade has cut through will become anomalously 'flavored', with human subjects reporting various fruity tastes despite no flavoring substances being present. Effect wears off after 15 minutes.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1903**
**Name:** R. Carter Williams
**Date:** 25/02/2022
**Total Items:** Five snow globes

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A snow globe, detached from the base. The base is severely dented and has been roughly cut into three pieces. Shaking the snow globe causes precipitation to fall from the sky in a 1.5-m radius around the globe. Once the globe is no longer actively being shaken, the precipitation ceases.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A sphere of glass filled with water, an unchanged base, and a pile of glitter. Heat is slowly transferred to the glitter from any surface the glitter is in direct contact with. Shaking the sphere of glass causes the water contained within to slowly freeze. Once the sphere is no longer being shaken, the contents quickly melt. The base shows no anomalous properties.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two small snow globes. One snow globe contains a model of a tropical beach, while the other contains a model of several carolers singing in front of a large snowman.

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A glass of water, a pile of glitter, and a cube of plastic. The plastic slowly cools anything within a 2-cm radius by up to 1 degree in total. Objects within this radius are also affected by an anomalous property that causes them to no longer absorb heat from their surroundings. The glass of water has the same effect, but heats objects instead of cooling them. Adding the glitter to the water caused it to stop exhibiting anomalous properties until the glitter was removed.

//Note: It appears that using the settings in the opposite order of the way it’s usually done caused the outputs to be “mixed up.” This could be a feature of 914, or it could be due to the fact that I usually test in the opposite order. - R. Carter Williams//

**Input:** One snow globe
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** A pile of glass and plastic shards. Glitter and water was dispersed throughout the output booth.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1904**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** --Six-- Five round blocks of rosin attached to pieces of cloth, for use in string instrument bows

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A clump of woven fiber attached to a thin plate of rosin

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small bow made of rosin with cloth in place of the bow hair.

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A detailed rosin sculpture of a pine tree, on a felt pedestal

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Seven arrowheads made of rosin, and a long piece of string

//Note: Is this a "bow" pun? - Belopaku//

**Input:** One block of rosin
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A small animate rosin statue of a stylized elephant, standing on a piece of cloth. The statue left the output booth and began running around Researcher Belopaku before collapsing into a pile of rubble.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1905**
**Name:** Researcher Connolly, Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 27/02/2022
**Total Items:** Three copies of the board game //Othello//

//Note: This is a two-player board game played on a 8 x 8 grid using 64 flat game pieces that are white on one side and black on the other. You play by alternating turns placing pieces on the board with your color facing up; any of the opponent's pieces that are in between your newly placed piece and an existing piece (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) are flipped over, which converts them to your own color. Whoever has the most pieces with their color facing up at the end of the game is the winner. - JR Boneka//

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Othelloreo//. All the pieces have been modified so that they are layered black-white-black, rendering the game unplayable since they are now black on both sides.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One altered board game, the lettering on the box indicating it to be titled //Hamlet//. Notably, the rules for the game state that one side must take a minimum of fifteen minutes debating and agonizing over their decision before making a move, and that all parties lose regardless of the outcome.

**Input:** One copy of //Othello//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One game board, two enlarged //Othello// game pieces. Testing reveals that when both of the pieces are placed on a flat surface, anything in between them is vertically flipped. Anomalous property was discovered when testing D-Class placed both pieces on each side of himself and was promptly overturned.

//Note: D-103821 was excused from testing and is currently being treated for minor head injuries in the infirmary. - JR Boneka//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1906**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zevezda
**Date:** 10/03/2022
**Total Items:** One KS23 shotgun, one USB drive containing the game //Escape From Tarkov//, one remote control model of a M1A2 main battle tank, one USB drive containing the game //War Thunder//

**Input:** One shotgun and one USB drive containing //Escape From Tarkov//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One KS23 with the USB drive integrated into the receiver. Further testing showed that when firing the shotgun, the user unconsciously aims at their own leg.

//Note: In// Escape From Tarkov //a strategy is to shoot enemies in their legs with shotguns. Apparently, 914 took that and my distaste for the game into account, creating this self-mutilation tool. - JR Zevezda//

**Input:** One tank model and one USB drive containing //War Thunder//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One modified remote-control model of an M1A2 main battle tank, with the USB drive used to modify the components used to receive movement commands. Upon the opening of the output booth, the tank drove towards JR Zevezda. It was soon discovered that the tank was draining funds from JR Zevezda's bank account at a rate of $16/hour and sending them to the bank account of Gaijin Entertainment, the publishers of //War Thunder//. It is theorized that this was done by way of the modified movement command receiver. The transfer of money ceased after incineration. 

//Note:// War Thunder //has already taken enough of my money and time. I think this is a hint I need to find a less time-consuming hobby. - JR Zevezda//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1907**
**Name:** Dr. Ari Marlon
**Date:** 16/03/2022
**Total Items:** One grogger, one copy of //Megillah Esther//
 
//Note: Purim starts tonight, so I thought I'd use a grogger and// Megillah Esther //for a holiday themed test. Purim is a Jewish holiday in which we read// The Book of Esther //also known as// Megillah Esther. //A grogger is a noisemaker used during the reading of// Megillah Esther. //- Dr. Marlon//
 
**Input:** One copy of //Megillah Esther//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One copy of the //Book of Ruth//
 
//Note: The// Book of Ruth //is a book in the Bible. - Dr. Marlon//
 
**Input:** One grogger
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One grogger that activates with mention of any form of dessert food within a four meter radius. When activated, the grogger makes a loud ringing sound that produces feelings of disgust.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1908**
**Name:** Dr. Arin Martinez, Junior Researcher Milan Dzudak
**Date:** 17/03/2022
**Total Items:** Five acoustic guitars manufactured by //C.F. Martin & Co.//

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Several piles of crushed Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra) fragments, a small pile of steel wire fragments of varying length and thickness.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** An acoustic guitar with the strings removed, six coiled steel guitar strings.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** An acoustic guitar manufactured by //Taylor Guitars//.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small hammered dulcimer, a pair of small wooden mallets. When the mallets are held, the person holding them is anomalously able to play the instrument at an intermediate level, even if they have never played a hammered dulcimer previously.

**Input:** One acoustic guitar
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An acoustic guitar of unknown manufacture. Markings on the headstock do not correlate to any known language or maker's mark. When played, the item eminates a strong antimemetic field around the player, rendering them unnoticed by those not on a regimen of Class-W mnestics. Any sounds made by the instrument are also subject to this antimemetic effect. The field dissipates almost immediately upon interruption of play.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1909**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Zen
**Date:** 31/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three metal models of the "Hidden Blade" from the videogame //Assassin's Creed II//

//Note: For the record, it's a gauntlet with a blade on the wrist that swipes in and out while moving the fingers. This model is for cosplays and has a dull blade for safety. - Junior Researcher Zen//

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin's Creed//, the first game of the series, which features a slightly different design.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One Hidden Blade similar to the one appearing in //Assassin's Creed III//, more complex than the previous ones, being a knife that comes out and rotates to get in the user's hand. However, this copy was sharper and harder to handle, and a tester lost two fingers while using it.

**Input:** One Hidden Blade
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One fully operational rope launcher actioned by an internal spring system, externally similar to the one appearing in //Assassin's Creed: Syndicate//, another game of the series. However, the rope, measuring only 10 m, was too thin to hold a human body and broke soon after the beginning of the testing.

**Test 914-1910**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 06/03/2022
**Total Items:** Three small plastic trash bins, six metal bottle caps

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A large plastic hat with the appearance of a straw hat, and two small metal models of a plastic bag full of trash

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large opaque plastic bottle with the appearance of a glass bottle, with a large metal cap. The bottle is empty, but human subjects will be led to hallucinate that the bottle is filled with various articles of trash when observing the inside of the object from the mouth of the bottle.

**Input:** One trash bin, two bottle caps
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An unchanged bin, with the unchanged bottlecaps attached to each side of the lid. The object appears to be animate and capable of speech. It vocalizes from an unknown source inside its body, but its lid moves up and down when it speaks, mimicking the movements of a mouth. It declared itself to be a ''trash monster'' and threatened to devour Hammond despite being stationary and harmless, which it vehemently denied. Put into soundproof container, and became inert after 2 hours.

**Output:** One copy of the 2010 film //The Last Airbender//, eight blank Blu-rays

**Input:** One complete set of //ATLA//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One complete set of //The Legend of Korra//

**Input:** One complete set of //ATLA//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A blue plastic tablet with a cognitohazardous symbol written on it that causes viewers to believe they can "bend" one of the classical elements by telekinetically controlling it or, in the case of fire, spontaneously generating it for approximately five hours, with no discovered way to halt its effects. Which element is assigned appears to be connected to the viewer's personality. Incinerated.

**Input:** One complete set of //ATLA//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A twenty-seven centimetre tall replica of series protagonist Aang, with eyes and tattoos marked in the reflective material on the bottom of the disc. When picked up by D-80764, output became animate and attacked with various forms of "bending", including spontaneous fire generation, apparent geokinesis and hydrokinesis, and wind generation. Subdued and smashed by security personnel after causing heavy damage to test chamber. D-80764 and Junior Researcher Elwin sent to medical bay for second-degree burns and a broken forearm, respectively. Remains incinerated.

//Note: I'll pay for the test chamber repairs. - JR Elwin//

**Test 914-1914**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 22/04/2022
**Total Items:** Three bottles of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Black Star// 

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//. The perfume had a considerably more powerful smell but dissipated very quickly in turn.

**Input:** One bottle of the perfume //Avril Lavigne Forbidden Rose//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A bottle with a similar appearance. When applying the perfume to a D-Class, the D-Class showed notable changes in their behavior, acting like a stereotypical ''emo'' teenager, adopting a sulking and negative demeanor, who was unable to stop singing the song ''Sk8er Boi'' by Avril Lavigne.

//Note: It stopped eventually, but we're unsure if it happened naturally or because the D-Class passed out from exhaustion after a while. - J.R. Perry//


-----------------------
**Test 914-1915**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Elwin
**Date:** 26/04/2022
**Total Items:** Three nylon flags of the type used by color guard in various colors on 1.8 meter aluminum poles

//Note: Color guard, for those of you who don't know, is basically dancing, but with big flags. For this test, I'll be using "tall" flags. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One black flag
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One thinner aluminum pole a meter in length attached to a vaguely triangular flag two meters in length, with aluminum threads woven into the fabric. The flag is patterned with gears.

//Note: I'm keeping this once it passes memetic screening, it's actually really pretty. - JR Elwin//

**Input:** One blue flag
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One flag identical to input, but floating in midair. Testing reveals that it maintains its position until moved by a force other than gravity.


**Input:** One red flag
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One autonomously spinning flag that constantly performs a simple color guard routine while anomalously levitating about a meter off the ground. When security forces attempted to grab it, it continued attempting to spin until it was forcibly shoved into the incinerator.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1916**
**Name:** Researcher N. Reyblanc
**Date:** 04/05/2022
**Total Items:** One complete collection of nine //Star Wars, the Skywalker Saga// DVDs

**Input:** One collection of DVDs
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One collection of DVDs with anomalous storage capacities. DVDs contain security footage of all security cameras of Site-19 Facility 23 every May 4th since 1978. Every human that appears on screen is replaced by a //Star Wars// character. Bonuses include an exhaustive and in-depth technical "making-of" video presented by Site Director Hackett and a teaser for "A Brand New Saga, coming September 14th".


-----------------------
**Test 914-1917**
**Name:** Intern Beauvillier
**Date:** 17/05/2022
**Total Items:** Three desk lamps

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One desk heater. Inner circuits have been redirected to produce maximal heat output while conserving the same power input as inputted lamp. However, testing has shown it is completely unpractical, as the heat output is so high that every standard issue ink evaporates after a few minutes of exposure.

//Note: I could escape from paperwork with this—I mean, incinerated. This is useless. - Intern Beauvillier//

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 99% efficient lamp. The filament appears to have been anomalously modified to reduce heat emissions to a minimum and maximize light output. However, disassembly of the light bulb to study the filament appears to have permanently neutralized its anomalous capabilities.

**Input:** One desk lamp
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A visibly unchanged desk lamp. However, turning it on drastically affects light conditions in the space it is turned on in. When turned on, it appears as if every object in the room is shined on from every angle, rendering a perfectly uniform lighting. Due to these conditions, it is impossible for the brain to correctly process distances.

**Addendum:** Output spontaneously neutralized during testing, as in a hasty attempt to switch it off, Intern Beauvillier collided with the table on which it was positioned and displaced it in such a manner that its light source was terminated on impact with the floor.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1918**
**Name:** Director of Research Dr. Lucius Veritas
**Date:** 26/05/2022
**Total Items:** One //Samsung Family Hub Smart Fridge//, one //Samsung Smart TV (Q-LED series)//, one //Samsung Add-Wash// washing machine

**Input:** One //Samsung Family Hub Smart Fridge//
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One //Samsung Family Hub Smart Fridge//. The refrigerator possesses a rudimentary AI assistant, similar to //SIRI// or //BIXBY//. Said assistant hacked into the nearest smart device (in this case, Dr. Veritas' mobile phone) and started producing text messages demanding to be filled with foodstuffs and to input the expiration date of all of them. When these messages were not answered, the refrigerator opened and attempted to cool the testing chamber below 0°C, threatening to ''freeze the lot of you to death''. It was unable to do so, since the performance of the refrigerator was not upgraded in any way. Anomalous properties did not recur after the refrigerator was unplugged.

**Input:** One //Samsung Add-Wash// washing machine
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One //Samsung Add-Wash// washing machine. The washing machine is autonomous, and attempts to locomote towards the closest article of clothing it deems dirty. However, the washing machine lacks any wheels, and instead opts to roll over multiple times to access the testing entrance, which quickly destroyed its internal structure.

**Input:** One //Samsung Smart TV (Q-LED series)//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One //Samsung Smart TV (Q-LED series)//. When turned on, the D-Class personnel directed to observe the output promptly burst into tears and described that he could see colours that never existed before, shapes that were impossible, and images that made him feel like he was under the influence of narcotics. The television showed noticeable signs of strain after a few minutes of broadcasting, started to produce blue smoke a minute later, and burned out completely a few seconds after. The D-Class collapsed, after which he was retrieved and recovered fully. The TV remained inert and was destroyed. The D-Class, upon regaining consciousness, described seeing a scenario where J.R. Perry would usurp Dr. Veritas' position of Director of Research by means of coup, but could not provide any further details.

**Test 914-1919**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 30/05/2022
**Total Items:** Seven flat head screwdrivers, seven Phillips head screwdrivers, and seven small articulated plastic action figures of Captain Janeway from the TV series //Star Trek: Voyager//

//Note: These action figures are not mine. I have never watched the show, and know nothing about it. - Belopaku//

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** One metal sphere and one plastic sphere

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A flat head screwdriver with the handle previously belonging to the Phillips head screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver head attached by the neck to the body of the action figure, and the original flat head screwdriver's handle attached to a plastic model of Captain Janeway's head

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A large plastic and metal object of an unidentified design. The phrase "Federation Standard Drive-screwer" is printed on its side. No such device is featured in any form of Star Trek media.

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Two similarly shaped plastic and metal action figures in the shape of anthropomorphic screwdrivers, and one small plastic tool of unknown purpose

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large action figure of what appears to be Captain Janeway with multiple decorative metal sections inserted into the length of her limbs, resulting in an unnatural elongated appearance. When it comes in contact with a human subject, the object will emit a sound resembling a voice speaking the words "Robot Janeway" via unknown means.

//Note: This is very unsettling to look at. - Belopaku//

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small, red plastic box with the words "Make Your Own Pop Culture Reference DIY Kit" printed onto the front. The box contains a small metal object in the shape of an arrow symbol. Subjects holding the metal object will temporarily be led to believe that anything the arrow is pointing at is a reference to popular culture.

**Input:** One flat head screwdriver, one Phillips head screwdriver, one action figure
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A very detailed model of the starship //Voyager// from the same TV series. Further inspection has revealed that the model depicts a full interior, and contains a single very small animate plastic figurine of Captain Janeway. Initially, the figurine was observed to be in a state of panic, and could be seen wandering around the halls of the miniature ship as if searching for something. After a few hours, the figurine was observed mostly in the captain's ready room, sitting in the chair and attempting to activate any of the nonfunctional electronic devices within. After about fourteen more hours of wandering around the interior of the miniature ship, the figurine eventually ceased movement.

**Test 914-1920**
**Name:** Researcher S. Sponson
**Date:** 30/05/2022
**Total Items:** Five pencils, five sheets of notebook paper

**Input:** One paper, one pencil
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Pencil was broken into several pieces and a cloud of toxic dust evacuated the booth shortly after it opened.

**Input:** One paper, one pencil
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Several strips of wood, laid on top of a paper covered in graphite. Upon gazing at the pieces, the person will exhibit a subconscious desire to describe the creation of the pencil from beginning to end.

//Note: SCP-914 separated information regarding the pencil’s history into a cognitohazard. I am intrigued, and pondering how this can be reproduced with future coarse outputs. - Researcher Sponson//

**Input:** One paper, one pencil
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One composition paper, two golf pencils, one small eraser.

**Input:** One paper, one pencil
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A pencil that is always sharpened. Studies have shown that this is taken in a literal sense, as removing all graphite from the body will result in the eraser becoming pointed.

**Input:** One paper, one pencil
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A wooden object built like a pen. When the clicker is pressed, all the graphite inside is expelled onto the user. The smudges caused by wiping the graphite are anomalously hard to clean off, resulting in most objects being smeared over permanently.

//Note: This experiment is to see how SCP-914 reconstructs complex objects that it disassembled itself. - Belopaku//

**Input:** One //iPhone 4S//
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Multiple cubes of various materials including metal, plastic, and glass.

//Note: The above test was repeated six more times, with similar outcomes. These have been omitted for brevity. - Belopaku//

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into multiple cubes of various materials
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A different arrangement of cubes now containing multiple materials in each cube.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into multiple spheres of various materials
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A small humanoid figure resembling a stylized muscular man, assembled from various spheres of the original input.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting cleanly into its component parts
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Multiple small gears and mechanical parts made from different materials, and a small metal plate with the words "The 914 Collection" engraved onto its face. Notably, most of the individual objects resemble a major visible component of SCP-914 when seen from the front.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into clusters of component parts
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A large animate model of a butterfly of unknown species, with the words "Apple iButterfly" printed onto one of its wings. The object is too heavy to fly on its own.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into equally sized slices
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A kitchen knife with multiple moving mechanical parts visible within its handle. The mechanical parts seem to serve no purpose, and move on their own without any identified power source.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into rectangular ingots of various materials
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An object resembling a Glock 19 pistol with moving legs. The object was incinerated immediately due to safety concerns.

**Input:** An //iPhone 4S// disassembled using SCP-914's Coarse setting into multiple non-functional smaller versions of an iPhone 4S
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A gray-colored model of an apple with a glass-coated metal exterior. Human subjects viewing the object will experience a strong desire to bite into it. The object has been safely put into storage after being scratched by the teeth of multiple personnel including Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku, D-54710, and Agent Alan Sedna during the containment process.

**Test 914-1922**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Liz Hammond
**Date:** 05/06/2022
**Total Items:** Five paperback copies of the Merriam-Webster English dictionary

**Input:** One dictionary
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A paperback book externally identical to a Merriam-Webster brand thesaurus. However, the majority of the information contained within appears to be incorrect.

**Input:** One dictionary
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A cylindrical stack of circular pieces of paper, bound together through the center. Each 'page' appears to be the contents of the original dictionary printed in a circular fashion around the center of the page. The top and bottom pages are laminated as if they are covers, and the front cover is labeled "The Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Circle Edition".

**Input:** One dictionary
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A paperback book titled "The Secret Dictionary of Words the Government is Hiding From You". The contents of the book consist of pronunciations, definitions, and usage examples of over 70,000 nonsense pseudo-English words in alphabetical order.

**Input:** One dictionary
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A hardcover book titled "The Meaning of Life". The contents of the book consist of the Merriam-Webster dictionary's definition for the word 'life' repeated over the length of the entire book.

**Input:** One dictionary
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An anomalous paperback book titled "The Writings of SCP-914". When opened normally, the contents of the book appear to be the entirety of the SCP-914 experiment logs written before the time of testing repeated multiple times. However, when a human subject closes their eyes and vocalizes the words "I wish this book was about" followed by a topic of any kind while in physical contact with the book's cover, the contents of the book will temporarily change into a long, verbose essay complaining about the mentioned topic in an overly clinical tone.

//Note: Don't ask me how the anomalous property was discovered. - Hammond//

**Test 914-1923**
**Name:** Archives Programmer Ford Trotsy 
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** Four identical 464cm x 140cm stereograms 

//Note: The hidden image inside these pictures is supposed to be a boat, but I can’t see it. - Trotsy//

**Input:** One 464cm x 140cm stereogram  
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Paper scraps were found spread evenly on the floor, seemingly arranged at random. 

**Input:** One 464cmx 140cm stereogram
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A 140cm x 464cm picture of a beach with the sun setting over the ocean. 

//Note: How is this at all related to a stereogram? - Trotsy//

**Input:** One 464cm x 140cm stereogram
**Setting:** Fine 
**Output:** A 464cm x 140cm stereogram its appearance was identical to the input image. However, exposure for more than 5 seconds allowed any viewer to immediately discern the image. 

//Note: Ok, well now this is definitive proof that the image was actually a pelican and not a boat like people claimed. - Trotsy//

**Input**: One 464cm x 140cm stereogram 
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A 464cm x 14cm painting that looked like a duplicate painting of “Relativity” by M.C. Escher. When attempting to touch the painting, objects will not make contact with anything and instead find open air. Subjects are able to go inside the temporal space and walk up and down stairs. Subjects are also unable to lose their balance. Subjects retrieved and painting stored in anomalous storage.

**Test 914-1924**
**Name:** Dr. Ari Marlon
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** Two cat pianos

//Note: A cat piano is a simplified piano shaped like the head of a cat with the piano keys as the cat’s teeth. - Dr. Marlon//

**Input:** One cat piano
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One visibly unchanged piano. Playing it causes it to produce live cat sounds.

**Input:** One cat piano
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One cat piano that plays random notes

//Note: When tested by D-Class with no piano playing experience, the output played outstanding pieces. However, when played by D-Class with experience, it produced audio consistent with that of an inexperienced player containing many errors such as wrong notes, inconsistent tempo, and rudimentary finger placement. - Dr. Marlon//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1925**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Joseph Carpenter
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One plastic children's harmonica

**Input:** One plastic children's harmonica
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One visually unchanged harmonica. The harmonica now radiates quite strong smells of what Researcher Carpenter and D-99735 described as a mix of grass, fire smoke, gunpowder, rain, and crayons. After playing, D-99735 reported feelings of a, “strong longing for the open, free country back out west. Far from civilization and corrupt Uncle Sam. I’d be free to eat all the ice cream I want without a bedtime.” After they finished their sentence, the harmonica released a short, sadly toned blues lick without human assistance or any blown air. A moment later D-99735 reported the feeling had passed and they were unsure why they spoke like they had.

**Test 914-1926**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One //Yamaha//-brand upright piano weighing roughly 350kg

**Input:** One //Yamaha//-brand upright piano
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One automaton made from the materials of the piano. The automaton consists mainly of wood with a sleek black and white finish, and an internal system of metal mechanisms and wires that allows it to be moved. It appears to be meant to be used as an exosuit, capable of fitting a human inside, who is able to control the automaton using a system of pedals. The mobility of the exosuit is rudimentary and bulky, with no discernible purpose, except that the exterior is covered in functional piano keys, including on the bottom of its feet, causing it to emit a very loud and dissonant piano noise every time a step is taken.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1927**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One positive organ

**Input:** One positive organ
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One humanoid statue made out of solid wood and clad in metal tiles. It possesses movable joints both in places where humans would and would not have them. Due to its design matching the one of object 914-1926, a test has been scheduled to record the interaction between both outputs.

**Addendum:** Shortly after placing the statue in the interior of the automation, both objects became animate. The amalgamation proceeded to throw itself onto its lower abdomen and roll around in the test area. Except for an incessant noise, no further activity has been recorded. Despite slowly causing damage to itself, this behaviour did not stop until both items were forcefully separated from each other. Security Agent Petterson was granted a convalescence period of seven days to recover from being hit by the objects' limb twice.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1928**
**Name:** Intern François Beauvillier
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** Two drum-sets, two pairs of drumsticks

**Input:** One drum-set and one pair of drumsticks
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A single, long drumstick and two particularly small drum-sets.

**Input:** One drum-set and one pair of drumsticks
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A left-handed drum-set. Can only be played in a left-handed configuration. Any attempt to rearrange the drum-set in a right-handed configuration will end with the drum-set arranged in a left-handed configuration. Any attempts to play in a right-handed position on the drum-set result in a noticeably decreased friction from the drumsticks, causing the player to often drop or let go of them accidentally. Anomalous property ceases when used in a left-handed configuration.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1929**
**Name:** Researcher MacLean 
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One //Marshall// brand guitar amplifier, one cello, one microphone

**Input:** One cello
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Three violins and two violas. The strings of the instruments are extremely frayed, presumably due to lack of mass.

**Input:** One microphone
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One microphone of an unknown make. There is a button labeled "Record" on its side. Pressing the button causes the subject to become mute, and all vocalizations fed into the microphone will be anomalously altered to match the voice of the original subject. This will persist until someone else presses the button, in which case the anomalous effect is transferred to them and the original subject regains their ability to speak.

**Input:** One //Marshall// brand guitar amplifier
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One //Marshall// brand guitar amplifier, with the dials modified to go up to 11 instead of 10. No other changes have been observed so far.

**Test 914-1930**
**Name:** Researcher S. Sponson
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One slide whistle

**Input:** One slide whistle
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One metal bracelet. When worn, any sound created by the user is turned into various musical instruments. Examples include: speaking becoming a ukulele sound, the person’s heartbeat becoming drums, and breathing turning into a flute. During testing, a D-Class subject was told to crack their back. The subject’s bones made a tuba sound of around 60 decibels when carried out.

**Test 914-1931**
**Name:** J.R. Evangeline Perry
**Date:** 09/06/2022
**Total Items:** One musical triangle

**Input:** One musical triangle
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A triangle of identical appearance. Striking it produces a sound similar to applying pressure to a near-empty bottle of a condiment, such as mayonnaise.

-----------------------
**Test 914-1932**
**Name:** Researcher Yuyuni Belopaku
**Date:** 12/06/2022
**Total Items:** Four full tubes of lemon scented moisturizing hand cream, and one empty tube of the same cream

**Input:** A full tube of hand cream
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small model of a human hand made of hand cream, resting on a plastic pedestal. The model collapsed within a few seconds under its own weight.

**Input:** A full tube of hand cream
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** A small plastic tub containing a portion of the unchanged cream, and a screw-on lid compatible with the tub lying upside down beside it. The tub is too small to contain all of the cream, and the rest of the substance has been splattered over the walls of the output booth, as if it was forcefully expelled from the opening of the tub.

//Note: When I try to put any kind of oily liquid into 914 next time, remind me about this test so I can reconsider. - Belopaku//

**Input:** A full tube of hand cream
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A hollow and anomalously rigid sphere of plastic, partially filled with what is assumed to be a separated colloidal mixture of various organic substances. The mixture appears to be capable of movement, resulting in the sphere being able to move itself in a rolling motion. The object shows a limited ability to perceive its surroundings, and is able to guide itself through complex paths.

//Note: Despite my desire to do so, and encouragements from a number of coworkers I will not name, I have decided against naming this object or keeping it as a pet. I know it shouldn't even be a question in the first place, but I am mentioning it here as a reminder to others that personal possession of anomalous objects should not be taken lightly. Some may know that I already have an anomalous sentient sphere under my care -- another output from 914 from over three years ago -- but it is from a time back when regulations were lighter, SCP-914 tests were a lot more frequent, and Research Cell 109-A was being cleared out every few weeks. It should not be considered a precedent. - Belopaku//

**Input:** A full tube of hand cream
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A tube of cream labeled "ANYTHING CREAM: USE IT FOR ANYTHING". When the contents are left outside the tube for over three seconds, the cream will anomalously undergo a chemical reconfiguration, turning into a liquid mimicking various household liquid substances such as dish soap, shampoo, lubricant, cooking oil, and hand sanitizer. The choice of substance appears to be random, and the substances often do not work as intended due to the limitations in chemical composition of the original substance.

**Input:** An empty tube of hand cream
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A flat plastic plate in the shape of a stylized lemon. Upon contact with a human subject other than Researcher Belopaku, the object will emit a 'squirting' sound similar to that of cream being squeezed out of a tube. When touched by Researcher Belopaku, it will emit a loud vocalization similar to the sound of him screaming.

//Note: Needless to say, the guards dispatched to my location were very confused. - Belopaku//

**Test 914-1933**
**Name:** Researcher Laskenta, Dr. N Rose
**Date:** 15/06/2022
**Total Items:** None. See note.

//Note: Due to 914's unpredictability and squandering nature, my previous attempts at recovering data from various storage devices have failed. In order to attain more tries with a single input, I will assay to put imaginary objects into the Clockworks. Since Test 914-0250 showed, that invading a human mind in this way might lead to the D-Class fainting, Dr. Rose injected a mix of adrenaline and Class-W mnestics into D-83785 and will watch them closely during the test. - Laskenta//

**Input:** Nothing. D-83785 has been shown an empty, functional USB drive and has been ordered to imagine this object in SCP-914's Input booth. In order to confirm SCP-914's capability to alter mental images the selection panel has been set and covered before D-83785 entered Cell 109-B.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Nothing. D-83785 reported to imagine an empty bowl and several sheets of paper containing schematics of various electronics in the Output booth. D-83785 - who has no technical background - was able to draw the circuit diagram of an arbitrary USB drive from memory, after being asked to reproduce one of the imaginary sheets. Additionally, they noted to feel "emotionally colder", despite being "highly interested" in the effect at play.

**Input:** Nothing. D-83785 has been shown a USB drive, storing a recipe for scrambled eggs as a .txt file. They have been cursorily informed about its content before being ordered to imagine the object in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Nothing. D-83785 imagined a steaming omelette on a black plate in the Output booth. Upon being asked about the omelette's inside, they announced with agitation that they saw "words pouring" out of it. All of the words D-83785 gave account of were present in the original input.

**Input:** Nothing. D-83785 has been shown a USB drive, storing an image of a screw as a .jpeg. They have not been informed about its content before being ordered to imagine the object in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Nothing. D-83785 began reciting the English Wikipedia article "Archimedes' screw" word for word as soon as the Output booth opened. They proceeded to ask gestural for writing utensils, with which they wrote the word "Aphantasia" three times before throwing them on the ground. As confirmed in later questioning, D-83785 was panicking, as they were not able to stop this behaviour at will. They lost consciousness after a few minutes, while quoting the "Design" paragraph.

**Addendum:** Following D-83785's collapse, Dr. Rose had them immediately transported to the medical bay for observation. While showing regular vital signs for an unconscious individual, Dr. Rose expressed concern for unseen effects of the testing, with expressive regards to brain damage. After a period of 7 hours, D-83785 returned to consciousness. They appeared to be anxious and easily startled, and were granted respite under medical observation, following a physical examination. D-83785 was returned to the medical bay and were able to attend to the customary interview afterwards.

//Note: This is not the first time 914 has shown it doesn't just affect matter within its physical system. Frankly, the risk is too high to continue this line of testing. - Dr. Rose//

//Note: Executive override. The risks are tolerable, the insights we've gained through just three tests are enormous, and the expenses are reasonable so far. - Veritas//

**Test 914-1934**
**Name:** Dr. Drive
**Date:** 15/06/2022
**Total Items:** One block of ice

**Input:** One block of ice
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One slightly warm ice sculpture in the structure of an electrical circuit breaker box, which seems to have been created through precise heating. 

//Note: This has got to be one of the worst puns I have ever seen. - Dr. Drive//

-----------------------
**Test 914-1935**
**Name:** Researcher S. Sponson
**Date:** 19/06/2022
**Total Items:** One shirt with the words “00 DAYS WITHOUT A DAD JOKE”

//Note: In celebration of Father’s Day. - Researcher Sponson//

**Input:** One shirt 
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One shirt, same as the input. When worn, the wearer will begin to spout jokes and puns at random intervals in a vocal pattern akin to a stereotypical father figure. However, all the jokes stated by the wearer are nonsensical, with each joke referencing topics too confusing for the recipient of the joke. The effect ends when the shirt is taken off.


-----------------------
**Test 914-1936**
**Name:** Researcher S. Sponson
**Date:** 20/06/2022
**Total Items:** One dossier on memetic effects

**Input:** One dossier on memetic effects
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One cube made out of folded paper. The cube, when held, attempts to deceive the holder with auditory hallucinations via various falsehoods. However, the cube has yet to successfully convince personnel of anything. Some examples of stated falsehoods are: convincing the holder that they are actually D-Class personnel, the current president of the U.S., or their neighbour being Santa Claus. Effect ceases after contact is ended.

**Test 914-1937**
**Name:** Jr. Researcher Daker
**Date:** 21/06/2022
**Total Items:** Five copies of the card "Lightning Bolt" from //Magic: The Gathering//

**Input:** One card
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Wood pulp, puddles of red, black, and blue dye respectively.

**Input:** One card
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** A copy of "Lightning Bolt" from earlier in the game's history, which has been heavily worn down.

**Input:** One card
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** The card "Counterspell", from the same game. Analysis shows that the normally blue dye added to the card stock's glue has been replaced with red dye.

**Input:** One card
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A card named "Lightning Strike" which deals 5 damage instead of "Lightning Bolt"'s 3 damage.

**Input:** One card
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A seemingly unchanged card. Upon retrieval, the card electrocuted D-53869, who was sent to the medical bay. 

-----------------------
**Test 914-1938**
**Name:** Intern Stephen McNamara
**Date:** 22/06/2022
**Total Items:**  One empty can of //Coca-Cola// soda

**Input:** One empty can of //Coca-Cola//
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A //Coca-Cola// branded novelty cup. Despite being the same volume of the original can, the cup fills up to two liters of the holder's favorite //Coca-Cola// product. Filling it with any other substance leads to the cup only holding its original volume of liquid. If held by a subject who prefers //Pepsi// brand sodas, the cup instead fills with two liters of the target's blood, causing near instantaneous exsanguination.

**Test 914-1939**
**Name:** Guest Researcher Zodiak
**Date:** 25/06/2022
**Total Items:** Nothing

//Note: I was inspired by other researchers' experiments to test SCP-914’s applications in trauma therapy and phobia treatment. - GR Zodiak//

**Input:** Nothing. D-17228, who has mild arachnophobia, was asked to imagine a spider in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Coarse
**Output:** Nothing. Upon opening the booth, D-17228 tried to escape the room, beating on the door with his fist. Upon questioning, D-17228 stated there was a swarm of tiny spiders pouring out from the booth. D-17228 was registered amnestics and permitted to leave for psychological evaluation. It was determined that D-17228s arachnophobia was made much more severe through this experience.

//Note: With the remaining tests, I am hoping that specifying a small, harmless example of their phobia will result in less severe reactions. - GR Zodiak//

**Input:** Nothing. D-17390, who has mild ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), was asked to imagine a garter snake in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Rough
**Output:** Nothing. When questioned, D-17390 stated the booth contained a mashed up snake, appearing as though it had been run over. After psychological evaluation, it was determined that the experiment had little to no effect on D-17390's phobia.

**Input:** Nothing. D-17390 was asked to imagine a garter snake in the Input booth.
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Nothing. When questioned, D-17390 stated the booth contained a deep hole with no apparent bottom which was ‘sucking’ him in. Psychological evaluation confirmed that D-17390 no longer had ophidiophobia, but had developed a moderate case of acrophobia (fear of heights).

**Input:** Nothing. D-17640, who has moderate trypanophobia (fear of needles), was asked to imagine a syringe in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** Nothing. When questioned, D-17640 stated the booth contained a syringe with a tag on it. The tag, according to D-17640, had the words ‘the cure’ on it. Psychological evaluation revealed that D-17640, while still suffering from trypanophobia, had their phobia somewhat reduced.

**Input:** Nothing. D-17640 was asked to imagine a syringe in the Input booth.
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** Nothing. Upon opening the Output booth, the D-Class started screaming incoherently about needles. D-17640 would not calm down until they were registered amnestics (only possible while the D-Class was restrained), and even then the violent reaction would reoccur when D-17640 saw a needle or syringe.

**Test 914-1940**
**Name:** Dr. N Rose
**Date:** 30/06/2022
**Total Items:** Three vials (8 dram) each of liquid estrogen and liquid testosterone

//Note: For once, I have time to experiment. I had to specially order these, since we usually only hold so much for our current transgender personnel. For anyone concerned about their identity, make your way to someone more educated than I. - Dr. Rose//    

**Input:** One of the aforementioned vials of testosterone
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** One vial of equal volume containing a clear substance. Chemical analysis indicates the substance to be identical to testosterone. Testing with the liquid resulted in the male characteristics of the test subject to rapidly dissipate. During testing with female test subjects, there were no discernible changes. 

**Input:** One of the aforementioned vials of testosterone
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An identical vial. Chemical analysis revealed the contained liquid to be identical to testosterone. Upon testing with D-Class, the liquid proved exceptionally dense, being difficult to extract into a syringe. Following injection into the forearm of the D-Class, they suffered from immediate muscular atrophy while simultaneously employing a heavily increased level of strength. The D-Class was terminated following near-assaults of Facility guards.

//Note: Freak-ish brute strength, to put it mildly. He looked like if Frankenstein could shapeshift, but it went horribly wrong. No guards were injured, despite attempts from the D-Class. I’ll conduct an autopsy with our coroners following these tests. - Dr. Rose//

**Addendum:** Following postmortem examination, the D-Class’ brain was scanned and found to be suffering from heavy degeneration of cells, particularly in regards to memory. Dr. Rose theorized that should the drug continue affecting it’s taker, full degeneration of the memory would occur within 10 hours. Muscular effects did not continue after the D-Class’ termination, however they were found to have incredible tensile strength, while proving to be weak and non-enduring.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned vials of estrogen
**Setting:** 1:1
**Output:** Three vials containing oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. All components of the output matched the mass and respective volume of the input. 

//Note: Estradiol is the major female sex hormone, and it's chemical equation is C,,18,,H,,24,,O,,2,,. 914 managed to separate the formula into it's components. Impressive, however I would recommend against using the material. - Dr. Rose//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned vials of estrogen
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** A Petri dish of liquid. Chemical analysis was unable to be performed, due to the output moving on its own accord. The liquid matter within the dish was capable of movement in a gelatinous matter, and would frequently move towards any personnel in its vicinity. Guards attempted to leave the chamber, however the liquid would clasp onto one guard’s, henceforth referred to as the subject, boot. Following their isolation, the liquid would force itself into the subject’s body via the nose. After this, the subject would fall unconscious for 46 seconds, before rising and aggressively attempting to escape. Subject did not respond to their name, rank nor demands. The subject was forcibly detained into an air-tight containment unit, to prevent the liquid output’s potential escape. The Petri dish was destroyed via the incinerator.

//Note: Even if the guard dies, it’ll be impossible to examine them. I recommend incineration following expiration. This thing gives me the creeps regardless… - Dr. Rose//
 
**Input:** The remaining vials of testosterone and estrogen
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A 16 dram vial of a clear substance. Chemical analysis revealed components of both testosterone and estrogen, however other components could not be identified; the overall mass of the substance remained the same though at a lower volume, being 13.4 dram total. Further testing may be required. Testing with the liquid proved it to be the same viscosity of heavily diluted blood. Following injection of the forearm of a D-Class, no immediate effects were recorded. This remained consistent for 12 hours. Following another hour, the D-Class fell sick, reporting stomach, muscular, abdominal and cranial pains described as ”someone stabbing me with a fucking rusty machete.” Six hours after a medical bay incursion, the D-Class was revealed to have both male and female primary and secondary characteristics and physicality. Over the following hours, routinely every 30 minutes the D-Class would complain of further abdominal pain before severely bleeding from the groin. D-Class was sedated and is receiving ongoing treatment following experiment.

**Test 914-1941**
**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka
**Date:** 30/06/2022
**Total Items:** One set of piano sheet music for the impossible composition "Rush E" by Sheet Music Boss

**Input:** One set of sheet music
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One composite sculpture exhibiting visible effects in which it becomes impossible for the viewer to write, type, or sound out the first letter of the English lexicon. Even English words using this letter become forbidden, so they must be switched out with substitutes. The effect subsides once the liquid which is used to expunge recent memories is provided.

//Note: Despite its title, the composition I inputted is not in the key of E, but in the key of the letter I'm currently prohibited from using. I'm slightly relieved it is this letter, not E, since circumventing words with the letter E would be much more difficult, I believe... though this is still extremely obnoxious. - JR Bonek//

**Test 914-1942**
**Name:** Dr. Dalton Magus
**Date:** 30/06/2022
**Total Items:** One map of Facility 19-23

**Input:** One map
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** One map in a medieval style of a nonexistent landmass resembling Facility 19-23. The paper is slightly browned, seemingly from heat treatment. The map is decorated with various annotations and mythical creatures, including a note in the approximate location of the administrative offices stating "Here be dragons", and a band of jesters in the staff quarters. Viewing the map causes a mild compulsion to speak in Old English.

**Date:** 30/06/2022
**Total Items:**  Two standard chess sets, complete with all thirty-two pieces

**Input:** One standard chess set
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** 32 humanoid figures (7 cm tall)  made of the same materials as the initial chess set. Outfits designate them in the same roles as the original pieces. The King and Queen of each side were approx. 15 cm tall. Before testing could commence, the figures engaged in combat with each other. While no major damages were documented, one of the rooks tossed a toothpick-sized spear at an attending researcher's eye. However, the mandatory eye protection blocked the attack. The figures have since been collected and incinerated.

**Input:** One standard chess set
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A wooden bowl and pair of chopsticks made out of the same wood as the original set. Testing with D-Class personnel indicates that when rice is eaten out of the bowl, the subject experiences vivid visual and auditory hallucinations of various military battle scenes, ranging from medieval knights to modern skirmishes. Other food eaten out of the bowl causes this effect only rarely.

**Name:** Intern Stephen McNamara
**Date:** 01/07/2022
**Total Items:**  One battery-powered smoke detector

**Input:** One smoke detector
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One visually unchanged smoke detector. As soon as the chamber opened, it began to sound despite there being no smoke. Disassembly and testing showed that the object now emits noise in the presence of any gaseous compound, up to and including SATP atmosphere. Object has been disassembled and incinerated.

**Test 914-1945**
**Name:** Intern Stephen McNamara
**Date:** 05/07/2022
**Total Items:**  One hardcover copy of the King James Bible, one paper Chinese takeout menu

**Input:** One King James Bible, one Chinese takeout menu
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** One hardcover book titled "Phonebook of Miracles". The book contains one-thousand-two-hundred pages containing various phone numbers that can be called to ask a figure known as the "High Creator" for certain favors, including the healing of diseases and the bringing of a bountiful harvest. The majority of the phone numbers called simply led to the caller being put on hold, with waiting music resembling choir singing in an unknown language.

**Test 914-1946**
**Name:** Dr. N Rose 
**Date:** 13/07/2022
**Total Items:** Three //3Dio Free Space// microphones

//Note: For whatever reason, we’ve seen a lower number of insomnia patients. I’m not complaining by any stretch of the imagination, but asking a few of our interns revealed they used ASMR videos. Non-scientific as they may be, these microphones are a common style used in these videos. - Dr. Rose//

**Input:** One of the aforementioned microphones
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** An identical microphone. When used for its intended purpose, the subject will anomalously lose all hearing ability, rendering them medically deaf. However, they will instead be able to hear through the microphone. This effect will sustain as long as the microphone is held and activated. Testing has resulted that objects, voices and movements are able to be heard through the microphone, but when tested with the subject’s ears, they did not respond; the microphone’s sensitivity was drastically lowered during the human ear examination to allow for accurate testing. Releasing the microphone will disable the effect.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned microphones
**Setting:** Fine
**Output:** A //Blue Yeti 3-Capsule// microphone. Using the microphone renders the subject unable to vocalize above 60dB, the average talking decibel level, and compels them to utilize objects and clothing that emit a “pleasing” or “soothing” sound. In ongoing testing, subjects have only been able to work with clipboards, mechanical keyboards, penlights, and their lab coats thus far. Heretofore, no way to resist or stop the effect has been discovered, and subjects will express physical pain when forced to perform tasks at a regular decibel level.

**Input:** One of the aforementioned microphones
**Setting:** Very Fine
**Output:** An identical microphone. When activated, all individuals within a 25 meter radius will instantaneously fall asleep. This effect goes through solid materials, including walls and windows. Use of vocalizations, rough movement or loud noise is unable to wake up affected subjects. Removing them from the radius does allow for subjects to awaken. Security personnel were notified of the test going awry following routine camera observation. The microphone was deactivated via use of a remote-controlled robot, and the effect ceased as a result. The microphone was incinerated and personnel who had unknowingly injured themselves during the effect were treated.

//Note: I was only notified of the effect being able to go through solid material AFTER I was woken up. Not only did I end up smacking my skull on the floor, but became a test subject unwillingly. While I recover from my concussion, don’t expect a happy British doctor for the next week. - Dr. Rose//

//Note: Never saw any happy British people to begin with, Rose. - Veritas//

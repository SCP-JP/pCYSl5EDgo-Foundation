**SHOCK** and terror swept through a busy evening in Manhattan as the body of Patrick O'Sullivan, an Irish laborer, was found on Monday.
@@ @@
Next to the East Harlem Ironworks, law enforcement would go on to inspect a door by the garbage disposal that contained his hideously mangled cadaver. They found a place only Hell knows. Drugs, organs, and alcohol sitting on dining and pool tables. As the brave men-in-blue ventured down an open cellar, they found eight rotting bodies. Only God knows what Devilish rituals were visited upon these virgin victims...

Last I checked, your boys imported the liquor and guns here. And your boys fooled around with the girls when they were being processed into Empyreans. Think Marina might want to know about how you and your boys might've caused those abnormalities while those things were incubating?

Try to tell your boys that when they ice-pick someone, they shouldn't leave'em in the fucking garbage bin. Because you think, like a dumbass, that leaving bodies in A PUBLIC GARBAGE BIN isn't going to attract attention? You didn't think some homeless guy would go rummaging around for food? At least have the decency to give the man a burial at sea -- one quick toss over the Hudson Bridge and problem solved.

It was an honest mistake. Besides, my boys and I got Marina's main squeeze out by using her and the girls. Maggie, wasn't it? She doesn't talk much, but my God, those wings were huge. Helped us fly out of Lockhouse when we saw a convoy of police cars driving down the road.

[[div class="darkbox redbox"]]
= **An Abridged Recounting of [[span class="bt"]]Operation TWO-TOED TREACHERY[[/span]]:**

Three days following the theft of the Oriykaklos Codex (SCP-6500-α-Codex) by agents of the Global Occult Coalition, an announcement was issued that Dr. Katherine Jean Sinclair and her husband, Alchemical Consultant Montgomery Reynolds, had been posthumously awarded the Foundation Medal of Honor, and that a funeral for both parties would take place in Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin where they had lived and worked most of their time in the Foundation.

Residual Narrative energies were manipulated to ensure that forces of the Global Occult Coalition, led by Martin Bowe, attempted to invade the Nexus on the same day as the funeral. The vast majority of the Site would be attending.

The Coalition successfully occupied the main urban center of Nexus-18, and attempted to capture all Foundation assets or Foundation-allied civilians for internment and/or interrogation, while planning to invade Site-87. However, Narrative forces within Nx-18 greatly hindered Coalition efforts in several ways:

* An unexpected reunion between an agent of the Coalition and her former grieving fiancé, who believed her to be dead, causing an entire Strike Team to turn against Bowe's forces;
* A group of teenagers incapacitating several agents and stealing weaponry and supplies, which were then used to fortify various schools within the city;
* The sudden re-emergence of UAE-Chapman-971 ("The Jamburglar"), whose presence hindered broadcasts and transmissions sent by Coalition forces;
* Several dozen survivalists distributing a vast array of weaponry to citizens trained to use it, while simultaneously providing shelter to civilians in bunkers of currently unknown size.

This culminated in Martin Bowe breaching the entrance to Site-87, whereupon he attempted to reach the Director's office in what is speculated to be an assassination attempt. The Director had been evacuated several hours previously; instead, he found Dr. Sinclair and Consultant Reynolds. While severely injured, with Sinclair nearly losing her unborn child, both had survived and were recovering.

Martin Bowe attempted to use energy from the Oriykaklos Codex to subdue Sinclair and Reynolds. The pair of them had been exposed to the Codex for over a month prior to Bowe's acquisition of the object, which caused the object to become attuned with their being. This, in turn, allowed Sinclair to work a rite which removed it from Bowe's possession, and placed it into the Foundation's.

Bowe's body was then subjected to the 'weight' of Malignant Narrative he had carried since his entry into Sloth's Pit, causing cardiac arrest. He is currently in critical condition, but is expected to recover and stand trial.

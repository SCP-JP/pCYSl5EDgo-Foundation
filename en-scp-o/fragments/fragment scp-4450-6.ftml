"Mornin' Overseers. It's nice to have all the big shots in one place. I hope ya don't mind if we smoke? Me and my brother are gaggin' for a cig."
 
"You can smoke."

"That's awful kind of you, Overseer. Smart move. Keep your business partners happy. I s'pose that smartness' why you call the shots in this here Foundation. I thi -- hey, I don't recognise any of ya. I hoped I'd see some familiar faces up on that board."
 
"We think it's important to employ a dynamic hierarchical structure to promote a mobile work environment for all our employees. It helps with morale."

"I  -- yeah -- yeah, that's what I figured. So, are ya willing to do business with us?"

"What's your demand?"
 
"Now, now, Overseers, I think you've got a misunderstandin' with us. This ain't a //demand//! This is us collectin' our debt. You outta know better by now that we're just businessmen."

"Businessmen that submerge islands when their debts aren't paid?"

"Oi, islands sink. Everythin' breaks after a time, don't they Chris?"

"Yeah, everythin' breaks sometime or another."

"And if ya want to keep it that way, I think a little cash could go a long way."

"<sigh> How much?"

"Well, seein' it like you numbskulls keep tryin' to paint us like crooks, I think 25 B's are in order."

"Ya goin' easy on 'em, Beryl."

"What can I say? I'm a lover, not a fighter."

"And if we refuse your dema-- and if we say no?"

"Well, Overseer... where are you from?"

"That's classified."

"Ah, c'mon Overseer! We're all friends here. I'll ask again, what country ya from?"

"I'm from France."

"The France in Europe? What a lovely continent."

"Would be a real shame if it were to break, eh Beryl?"

"That it would be, Chris. That it would be."

"Are you seriously -- are you threating to destroy //Europe?//"

"No, no, no, no! There ya go misunderstandin' us again, Overseer. It's not like that at all. It's just -- It's just that when my brother and I don't get our money, we get awful clumsy."

"Very clumsy, yes. We can 'ardly control ourselves. And I'm sure you know what it's like when we get clumsy. It would be a shame if we broke somethin' important, wouldn't it?"

"You'll get your money. But first, we would like to ask a few questions."

"You what? Overseer, oh overseer. It wouldn't be right. We're not here for some ol' chit chat, are we Chris?"
 
"C'mon Beryl, they've been pretty good clients of ours, haven't they? We should give 'em somethin'."

"Oh, go on then. What's ya question, overseer?"
 
"Are you two.... human?"

<laughing> 

"Are we human, he says! What a laugh. We look like little green men, do we?"

"Just 'cause we make a deal with a friend of ours. No shame, you Foundation types, no shame."

"What did your deal entail?"

"Ah, not too much. We act faster, zip around the place. And we're basically hard as nails. Right, Beryl?"

"Hard as bedrock. Nothin' can take us down, not even that magic ninja fella that you guys sic'ed on us."

"Digital transfer of the agreed upon budget is being transferred to your account as we speak."

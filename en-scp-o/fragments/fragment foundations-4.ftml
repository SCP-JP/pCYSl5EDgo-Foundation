Dear Professor Cabenwald:  

@@     @@The hardest part proved to be securing the polonium. Its scarcity (a consequence of its brief half-life) makes it prohibitively expensive. Robert nevertheless succeeded in acquiring a sufficient amount.
@@     @@The contraption itself is a lead-shielded mechanism that, when triggered, exposes the polonium and produces a ray of alpha particles from its very tip. It is automated and, as per your suggestion, powered by two Leclanch√© cells. A punch-tape feed controls the trigger mechanism, allowing us to loop a pattern for as long as our supply of polonium lasts.
@@     @@Given the content of the arriving message, we decided to escalate the stakes: We transmitted the first //seven// primes. Immediately after our first loop completed, the anomaly ceased to emit any detectable trace of radiation. 
@@     @@Several seconds after that, it resumed emitting radiation at a far more furious pace.
@@     @@What we recorded was a series of dense clusters of brief pulses and long bands. It lasted for approximately two minutes before ceasing. Upon examination, I could make neither heads nor tails of it -- Robert, however, recognized it instantly. He worked in the telegraph office at South Station as a young boy. There, he learned to read Morse as plainly as reading a book. 
@@     @@The message was written in English. It informed us to stand by for a second transmission that will commence two weeks from now. This message will exceed five million characters, and thus shall require approximately two hundred and sixty days to complete. 
@@     @@I jested to Robert that we may need an additional roll of paper.

Eagerly awaiting your arrival, 
@@     @@Mrs. Annette Lang-Scranton

hector.aic was inserted into SCP-7000’s consciousness without error. Foundation engineers monitored the dialogue closely, however, before any confirmation could be made the log was prematurely closed, presumably by hector.aic. 3 hours later, upon exiting SCP-7000’s network, hector.aic held itself ransom, claiming that it would destroy itself and wipe everything under its control if the Foundation interfered with SCP-7000's presence within the town of Joseph.  The O5 Council and its subsidiaries held a seminar to discuss the proceeding actions, and decided that it would be beneficial for all parties involved to adhere to these claims, despite the greater value involved in the retrieval of ALICE than the survival of hector.aic.

Post-meeting comments can be seen below:

[[div class="blockquote"]]
ALICE's Artificial Intelligence system is outdated by modern standards. Reconstruction of a similar system without the same moral implications is significantly easier now than before. The reality bending systems are replaceable -- we already have spares in storage. The loss of SCP-7000 does not mean the loss of the ALICE array. It is simply a minor setback in a much more promising future of Foundation predictive development.

I vote no.

The ethical ramifications of voting yes would be obscene. I was not employed by the Foundation when Project Phaethon was in progress, and I will do everything in my power to prevent a similar result.

We, as an organization, must strive to be better. There'll always be another chance to develop our technologies.

There is no greater good here.

My colleagues were offered the fruit, and of course, they ate from it.

We will no longer succumb to hubris.

We have been given the chance to correct our mistakes. We will take that chance.

24 Hours later, an expedition of engineers was sent into the perimeter in order to retrieve the Reality Alteration Drives from SCP-7000’s Central Computational Cluster, removing its reality-adjusting capabilities. As per the meeting agreement, the CCC was connected to a permanent power supply in Joseph, allowing it to retain its observation functionality. The CCC was disconnected from the rest of the supercomputer, including its predictive systems. ALICE itself was left untouched.

On 07/10/22, hector.aic and its supervisor were awarded the Foundation's Alexandra Cross, for a combination of outstanding bravery, prevention of widespread loss of life, and devotion to our organisation's founding principles in times of extreme difficulty and cost. Despite undergoing various modifications since their conception, these principles still ring true today: to secure a prosperous future for mankind, to contain the unknown dangers that exist in our world, and to protect those that deserve and need protecting.

The ceremony will be conducted in person at the Site-52 Concert Hall. hector.aic will participate via Zoom.

As of writing, hector.aic is the only .aic instance to receive a Foundation medal of honour.

----
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7000 has been moved into a secure storage unit within the bounds of Joseph, Oregon. SCP-7000 must be monitored remotely, with a member of Foundation personnel confirming the observed state of affairs on a monthly basis. Otherwise, SCP-7000 poses no threat to normalcy, and should be ignored.

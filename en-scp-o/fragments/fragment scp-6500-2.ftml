[[span class="bt"]]__**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:**__[[/span]] Each Site is to review its containment records and determine which anomalies under their purview would cause negligible harm to humanity or widespread knowledge of the anomalous. These items are to be designated Non-Disruptive Anomalies, and their containment will be discontinued or reduced to simple observation. Operationally, this shall include, but is not limited to the following measures:

* Humanoid anomalies with a record for cooperative behavior are to be injected or fitted with tracking devices (if their biology/anomaly allows for such measures) and released. Each may be provided with a new identity on a per-case basis;
* Religious and mythical artefacts will be returned to their respective cultural lands or peoples;
* Animals and other organisms will be released into the custody of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions or similar Groups of Interest with the means to care for them in a less restrictive environment;
* Tomes and grimoires are to be turned over to Serpent's Hand operatives for return to the Wanderer's Library. An ambassador from the Library has granted the Foundation temporary immunity for overdue items;
* Anomalous locales are to be afforded the same level of agency granted to Nexuses. Policing of their borders will be severely reduced.

It should be noted that the above actions have thus far been insufficient at reversing the effects of SCP-6500, but have somewhat slowed its process. 

Following a meeting of the Departments of Tactical Theology, Applied Thaumaturgy, and Invocational Pataphysics, it has been determined that all operations involving SCP-6500 must contain elements of esoterica, up to and including documentation, the code of which is to be lined with protective wards where possible. 

[[span class="bt"]]__**PROTOCOL SIXTH SUN:**__[[/span]] All special missions (Paths) undertaken in the pursuit of counteracting or neutralizing SCP-6500 are to incorporate ritualistic aspects as to not upset the integrity of the sought items (SCP-6500-α), or risk said items' corruption due to SCP-6500's influence. Personnel accessing Protocol Sixth Sun materials should expect drastically atypical presentation formats as a necessary side-effect of these rituals, and of the thaumaturgical mechanisms protecting their contents.

[[span class="bt"]]__**DESCRIPTION:**__[[/span]] SCP-6500 is a process of entropy exclusively targeting the anomalous. This primarily affects, but is in no way limited to, various forms of thaumaturgy (colloquially known as "magic"). SCP-6500 is responsible for over 1,500 neutralizations of anomalous persons, items, areas, and phenomena over the past decade.

SCP-6500 takes many forms; for example, a process of accelerated senescence in organic anomalies, including those heretofore considered immortal. Objects which are foreign to baseline reality -- whether it be through temporal displacement or transference from alternate or higher planes of existence -- have either faded to the point of intangibility before complete non-existence or suffered from violent structural collapse due to their incongruity with known laws of spacetime.

Since its formal recognition and study, it has been determined that SCP-6500 is hastened by containment efforts. Without intervention, the complete neutralization of all known and undiscovered anomalies is predicted to occur within a five-year period, irrevocably altering the state of the universe and rendering our organization obsolete.

Quiet days are upon us.

One would be forgiven for viewing this as a desirable goal. To be free from the anomalous. To usher in a new age of reason, where there can exist nothing outside our realm of understanding. A world where we would not have to watch our brethren die in the dark, unaccomplished and forgotten.

One would be forgiven for wanting to go home to their family, to look them in the eye and assure them everything is going to be okay. That there is nothing left to go bump in the night.

One would be forgiven.

Since our inception, countless generations of noble men and women have dedicated their lives to the suppression of that which eludes understanding. They have stood stalwart on the precipice of the unknown, staring defiantly into the abyss. They mocked its gaze.

Why then, should we not honor their tradition? Why spurn their sacrifice? Why should we move to proliferate that which we've so stubbornly locked away?

SCP-6500 represents the end of magic. The end of stories, and of dreams. The utter desolation of countless sapient, feeling lives. The destruction of communities. The fracturing of whole cultures and religions. It is an unnatural and intolerable eradication of untold worlds.

It is condemnation, unforgiving in its totality and unflinching in its march towards oblivion.

To allow for it to continue on its course is to fail in our mission to Protect. To cede to its influence would be to permit it to rob our world of wonder. To stand by would be tantamount to genocide.

And that, that cannot be forgiven.

[[span class="bt"]]__**HISTORY:**__[[/span]] Though SCP-6500 is a relatively recent development, the possibility of such a phenomena occurring has been posited in the past by various religious and occult groups and individuals. Within the Wanderer's Library, SCP-6500 is known as "Cipactli’s Feast" or simply "The Impasse," an event which is prophesied to herald the "Final Occult War."

The earliest attestation thought to refer to the SCP-6500 phenomena was recorded by an unknown scholar in a collection of Sarkic scripture. It is a mythicized retelling of Grand Karcist Ion's felling of the Daevite city of Kurst.

Regarding its discovery by the Foundation, SCP-6500 was originally hypothesized by one of its founding members: an individual known to the original five Overseers as O5-0.

Due to the inconsistent record-keeping in the Foundation's infancy, little information exists regarding O5-0's history and personal life, much of it contradictory. The only aspect of their tenure widely regarded to be factual is that the moniker "O5-0" was applied to them as an offense due to their refusal to hold a seat of leadership among the other Overseers. The following apocryphal accounts describe potential O5-0 candidates according to various sources:

[[div class="lightbox" style="background-color: #D8ECF4;"]]
= **"The Ragged"**

Among the primary accounts of O5-0 is the personal journal of the first O5-4. In it, O5-0 is described as a middle-aged Caucasian man hailing from an uncertain Nordic country, named Norris Arklay. He is described as an "//aloof collector of curios with an air of affluence about him, all in tattered cloth ill-equipped to conceal his manhood. Had he been accompanied by mutts, one would think him Diogenes!//"

Throughout his writings, O5-4 characterizes Arklay as a madman, continually critiquing the burgeoning Council's decisions and directives while simultaneously distancing himself from a position of actual power. Only begrudgingly does O5-4 compliment Arklay, after an unnamed incident which saw Arklay devising a containment protocol for a self-replicating anomaly that had claimed two Foundation lives.

Of Arklay's split from the Foundation, O5-4 writes: "//We can only be better off without [him] ...the others seem to be bothered by the loss of his personal collection of artifacts and antiquities, but it is of no concern to me if he took his toys like a petulant child.//"
[[/div]]

[[div class="lightbox" style="background-color: #D7EFE7;"]]
= **"The Florist"**

From the records of the Global Occult Coalition come a series of letters drafted by a member of the Bavarian Illuminati named Bertram Suthmeer, who had been tasked with spying on the early Foundation's members. Bertram tells of a young, olive-skinned woman named Nur who "//holds no office, though her words nevertheless hold weight.//" She is described as an accomplished botanist, seeking to explain the existence of the anomalous and their place in the natural order.

Due to Bertram's focus on the more audacious actions of the main Council members, little attention is given to Nor over his years of observation. Though he admits to being unaware of the exact situation surrounding Nor's departure, he notes:

"//It is funny. I had always felt an unnerving sense of unease, and of danger, in my time documenting the actions of these animals. It was as if there was a weight about the air, a cold blanket of malaise and fear that fell upon me while in their presence. I had assumed this to be a mere product of the mind, a harmless delusion triggered by my station, and nothing more. The day that woman vanished, dear brother, so too did that loathsome pressure.//

//I believe I have made a grave mistake.//"
[[/div]]

[[div class="lightbox" style="background-color: #FFDABF;"]]
= **"The Humanist"**

A record from the Founding Chair of the Ethics Committee, [IDENTITY REDACTED], describes their early actions within the Foundation and their stringent supervision by an "honorary Overseer" who informed many of the Committee's initial duties and principles. This Overseer would communicate to the Chair exclusively by telephone, and was described as "an intelligent and fearsome advocate" for ethical considerations regarding anomalous subjects.

As the record continues, the Chair describes the repartee achieved with this Overseer, whom they begin to refer to as "Zero." "//With her guidance,//" the Chair writes, "//necessary resources for humanoid containment have lessened by twenty percent. Beyond the moral incentives for ethical treatment of the anomalous, its efficiency is undeniable.//"

However, their communications grew less frequent as the Ethics Committee became a self-governing body. In the months following their last communication, the Chair reports the internal arrest and trial of a high-ranking Foundation operative whom they identify by voice as Zero. This person was reportedly unable to be convicted of their supposed crimes, as they held no formal position within the organization; they were instead exiled from the Foundation via forced retirement.

"//It is with a heavy heart I tender this letter to the persons it may concern. I am no longer able to provide my services to the Foundation in good conscience. This administration has made clear its distaste for the ethical concerns of the anomalous, and they have exiled the woman to whom I owe my career.//" -- Founding Chair, Ethics Committee, final record
[[/div]]

O5-0 would leave the Foundation due to ideological differences regarding the organization's growing spread and influence. The Overseers did not perceive SCP-6500 as a possibility, and thus dismissed O5-0's proposal to limit the Foundation's scope.

After their disappearance, O5-0's quarters were searched. Surviving personnel were able to recover several dozen notes regarding four anomalous artifacts (collectively designated SCP-6500-α), alongside notation from O5-0. Throughout, they are referenced either in relation to other anomalies, or in their relation to SCP-6500. 

The retrieval of these items has been deemed paramount to continued operations.

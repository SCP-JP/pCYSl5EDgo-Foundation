The as yet unidentified group represented by The Questioner has a history of sabotage and attempted hostile takeover with The Factory. This stems from what appears to be a difference of opinion on resource management. On November 13, 2001 this unidentified group began a series of sabotages against Factory assets at the Fort Cass location.

The Questioner was last observed near the base of the //Nyssa sylvatica// instance at the center of The Factory. 
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
The Investor enters the Factory alone as any misstep or misspoken word could result in a breakdown of negotiation. 
[[/cell]]

[[row]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
The Questioner does not leave their position at the base of the //Nyssa sylvatica// as basic etiquette would generally dictate. In fact, The Questioner does not acknowledge the presence of The Investor.
[[/cell]]
[[cell style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%"]]
The Investor had been appropriately briefed before leaving for negotiation and shows no reaction to The Questioner's rude behavior. As well, The Investor restrains himself from conducting any typically suitable greeting.[[footnote]]

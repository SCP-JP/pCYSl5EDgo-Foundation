**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5451-2A instances are to be stored in a standard containment locker. No animals of the family //Spheniscidae// are allowed to make contact with the advertisements. SCP-5451-2B instances found to have memetic effects are to be blocked by [[[SCP-5863|Foundation Web Crawler Πουλί]]] . All materials released by SCP-5451 is to be disseminated as Foundation Cover R621 ("Online Roleplay"). In addition, a Foundation web crawler is to track the posts and conversations of SCP-5451-1 instances to detect any anomalous activity.

**Description:** SCP-5451 is a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family //Spheniscidae//, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interact with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.

SCP-5451-1 are a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that can access the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances are done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turn into SCP-5451-1 instances when they come into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) come in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.

SCP-5451-2A instances are flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They are found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that come into contact with SCP-5451-2A turn into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they are enrolled in SCP-5451.
SCP-5451-2B instances are banner ads found on the Internet. They take the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text "(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!", or some variation of the text. Subjects that come into contact with an SCP-5451-2B instance have a 25% chance of contributing to penguin conservation efforts using the forums.

**Addendum 1.1: Attempted Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances**

Analysis of various SCP-5451-2A instances reveal no thaumaturgic alterations

[[/collapsible]]


**Addendum 1.4: Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances**
To learn more about the culture of SCP-5451-1 instances, Junior Researcher Cook, under the username "beep beep lettuce", interviews multiple SCP-5451-1 instances under the guise of a school project over multiple months. After 10 months, Junior Researcher Cook publishes a paper entitled //The Culture of SCP-5451: A VIew Into the Life of Anomalous Penguins Through an Online School//. An excerpt of the paper is available below along with an excerpt of the interviews done by Junior Researcher Cook on SCP-5451-1 instances.
A copy of the full paper and interview log can be received from either Junior Researcher Cook or Senior Researcher Drake.  

[[collapsible show="+ Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances" hide="- Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances"]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
1. **Family Life**
SCP-5451-1 instances have a close-knit relationship with their family, not unlike non-anomalous penguins, despite having the mannerisms of non-anomalous humans. In a sense, their relationship with their family is like a fusion between non-anomalous humans and penguins.
SCP-5451-1 instances have a noticeably close relationship with even their cousins thrice removed, as most of them live together in packs, like non-anomalous penguins. However, when it comes time for SCP-5451-1 to leave their house to start their own lineage, they are given a copy of a recipe that both their mother and father made.

In fact, it is a rite of passage for an SCP-5451-1 instances to cook their first meal without the assistance of their parents.
A marriage proposal between two SCP-5451-1 instances consists of cooking a traditional recipe from their families and presenting their meal to the bride/groom.
Due to their food recipes being passed down from generation to generation, SCP-5451-1 instances take great pride in their lineage.

Being a cook is considered to be the highest honor among SCP-5451-1 instances, and recreating their families' dishes while adding their own touch is considered to be one of the important things parent SCP-5451-1 instances must teach to their children.

2. **Cuisine**
 Although mainly inspired by American cuisine, the recipes made by SCP-5451-1 instances noticeably have fish in them, with some seaweed mixed in for umami.
 Most of the dishes SCP-54511 instances call "traditional" are Inuit recipes, suggesting a link between Inuit culture and SCP-5451-1 instances. In addition, most traditional SCP-5451-1 dishes involve some sort of food preservation technique, whether that be fermentation or drying food.
 Due to globalization, other methods of cooking food has reached the SCP-5451-1 instances. This has developed their cuisine so much, younger SCP-5451-1 instances are having a hard time developing their own recipes due to the amount of methods possible.
 
Some notable food preparation methods that SCP-5451-1 traditionally use are:
* Fermentation of fishes
* Freezing of fishes to be eaten raw
* Drying of seaweed under the sun for consumption
* Smoking

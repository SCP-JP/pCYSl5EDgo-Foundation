Hi!

**Item #:** SCP-3939

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** //Uhh, how does this section work? I don't know what this means and I don't want to mess this up so I'll say it's contained. That's fine, right?//

**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.

SCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power. Additionally, SCP-3939 possesses the ability to speak with a voice transmitted through the horn and potential sapience. Thus far it has only been shown to speak to certain people.

The brass horn always rotates to point at the observer. Other observers will see the horn rotate to point towards them. 

//Tests to ensure a trilobite free environment are underway!//

You won't die here. You spin around and scramble for the exit. Your foot clinks against the edge of a warhead--

> Narratively-simulated blue sky. The rising sun casts long shadows through the wreckage in the crater that used to be the Safe-class storage wing of Site-39. Gunhead Anomalocaris wriggles out from under a pile of concrete and spots the explosion's epicenter, where Senior Researcher ████ ████████ should be standing. Whoops.
> 
> Their narrative cannon -- pitch-white and flickering between 2 and 3D -- extricates itself from between the torpedo launchers in their head, taking aim. Ethereal strings of storylines zip through the sky and converge in a flash of white. Anomalocaris sighs, ready to reset this narrative branch.

++ Special Containment Procedures:
###cfcfcf|//SCP-7000 should not be contained and there are no procedures to do so. SCP-7000-2 and SCP-7000-3 are to be kept in a server that resides in a secure holding area accessible by only O5 permission, the files cannot be accessed except by direct ethernet connection to the server. Access to SCP-7000-2 is restricted to Overseer and ethics commitee permissions.// SCP-7000-2 is to be used liberally on any applicable Foundation official documents, uniforms, doors, decor, or other related Foundation paraphernalia as necessary.##

###cfcfcf|//In the event that the SCP Foundation is compromised in any manner and the veil of secrecy is broken, the Chrysothemis Contingency should be present as a solution to resolve it. Should the Chrysothemis Contingency be activated, all Foundation staff of clearance level 3 or higher unlock will access to SCP-7000-3.//##

SCP designation numbers are not to be in dated order, this is to prevent attempts at discerning the first contained objects and newest contained objects, as well as prevent the discerning of the Foundation's origins by looking through the first contained objects, including SCP-7000.

SCP-7000 and SCP-7000-2 have proved useful to the Foundation, however, SCP-7000 should be called only when absolutely necessary. Knowledge of what SCP-7000 truly is beyond being "The Board" is limited to O5-6 access.

++ Description:
SCP-7000 is a an entity named "The Board", an extradimensional intelligence that appears to be residing within the human psychosphere, otherwise known as the human collective unconscious (More information regarding this is pending experimentation approval by order of the ethics committee, see project PNEUMA). The entity was originally found and contacted by Dr.████████ before becoming O5-6. The method for contacting SCP-7000 is known only to O5-6.  SCP-7000-2 was originally created by SCP-7000. 

###cfcfcf|//SCP-7000-2 is a visual anti-memetic anomaly in the form of an image, or a representation of the image with a margin of error allowing for scratches, warping, or fading without any effect on the strength of the anomaly. Viewing SCP-7000-2 will, under the circumstance that the subject is not specifically trying to find it, cause a slight amnestic effect so that when removed from short-term memory, will be "erased" from long-term memory, along with any associating memories containing SCP-7000-2 within it.//##

###cfcfcf|//The extent to which memory of it is "erased" depends on the individual. It appears nearly invisible to memory and, without strong concentration on it, SCP-7000-2 is rendered nonexistent upon removal from view into the purview of object permanence. A secondary effect of this is that the subjects don't express the need to question this effect.//##

###cfcfcf|//This ability is neutralized by concentrated training on the association of an archetypical concept or object to SCP-7000. This cannot be performed unless specifically intending on doing so and has a low chance of being associated accidentally.//##

SCP-7000-3 is a counter-meme to SCP-7000-2 and was created when [DATA EXPUNGED]. It is a counter-meme that removes all association people have with SCP-7000-2 and thus erases memories associated with it. The image itself is to be used in only emergency situations.

SCP-7000-2 cannot be identified through any method of finding memes, nor can it be neutralized with an anti-memetic agent or Y blockers, making it nearly impossible to identify except through observing its effects directly. Research into this effect is ongoing.

SCP-7000-2 has the secondary effect of reinforcing the connection the viewer has with SCP-7000, which allows SCP-7000 minor effect over those affected through ringing sound which may cause the affected to search for a phone and picking up the phone to hear an, often single-word, message. Occurrences of this are incredibly rare and those who hear these messages don't remember doing so except when questioned directly about it. Those directly aware of SCP-7000, its nature and are fully aware of its effects, can elect to ignore these messages and are aware they come from SCP-7000.

SCP-7000 can be directly contacted through means known only to O5-6, this knowledge is limited only to O5-6 due to the nature of SCP-7000. Most of what is known about SCP-7000 is personal testimony from O5-6 who often refers to it as female, and on occasion the [DATA EXPUNGED], both are usually done by accident. SCP-7000 has been given the designation "Thaumiel" (See Discussion 7000-A) which is a new classification for anomalies designed to contain other anomalies, in this case, all of them.

The ideals and goals of SCP-7000 seem to inexplicably align with the Foundation's and have assisted the Foundation on multiple occasions. It has been demonstrated to have knowledge of various anomalous phenomena when questioned about it, however, its information is oftentimes vague or cryptic.

The anomaly was first discovered when O5-6, who then was a [DATA EXPUNGED] working for the Foundation, put forward the idea of [DATA EXPUNGED] to O5-4. This information along with now O5-6's prior experience and dedication to Foundation goals granted them an invitation to a seat on the O5 council, which was promptly accepted.

[[/div]]

//A cassette player hums, slowly crescendoing. A button clicks and audio plays, the crackling of the old tape is interrupted by various sounds, difficult to comprehend, assumedly a cognitohazard that kills any unauthorized listeners. Smart, for such an early foundation, you think.//

//The voice of a woman, soft-spoken, yet direct, affirming with a slight south African accent can be heard.//

**O5-1:** Call to order, I suggest we state for the record our names. O5-1 present.

//The whirring of machinery can be heard as metal can be heard shifting along with a female presenting robotic voice//

**O5-2:** O5-2, designation name Sophia, present.

//A reassuring voice, almost calming just to listen to, with a Japanese accent enters.//

**O5-3:** O5-3, Philosopher present.

//A brash, playful voice enters with a prominent Australian accent, sounding relaxed.//

**O5-4:** G'Day all, O5-4 here, call myself the Ambassador.

//A southern accent enters, skeptical in tone.//

**O5-5:** Engineer O5-5 here and present. Now may I ask why in the sam hill are we gathered here again? Usually, it's damn important when we're all here together so what, end of the world? Again?

**O5-1:** Good, we're all present. Nothing like that Five, didn't you read the memo?

**O5-5:** Look, ma'am, I am involved with six site constructions at the moment and the security systems involved with them. 

**O5-4:** I don’t think that’s an excuse to not-

**O5-1:** (Cough) Well, Five I'm sure four can explain the situation, you proposed it after all.

**O5-4:** Oh uh, right. So proposition, one minute let me get my papers I didn't think I'd be explaining this again.

//The sound of paper shuffling can be heard for a few seconds before a decisive flip of paper.//

**O5-4:** Bingo. Here we go, so from the top I'll give you the long and short of it, "Proposition to incorporate SCP-7000 into command structure" (incomprehensible) "The benefits of doing so are great" (incomprehensible) "Adding a logo to the Foundation" (incomprehensible)

**O5-5:** hold on. Reminder that we’re trying to remain secrecy here. You want to give us an easily recognizable logo to spread around like a meme? I'm sorry Four but that dog don't hunt.

**O5-4:** (Assuredly) I wasn't finished.

**O5-5:** Sorry, continue.

**O5-4:** The logo itself will be SCP-7000-2, it's an anti-meme, we've done some tests on it, Two?

**O5-2:** During tests, we discovered that among participants there is always a non-zero chance the participants completely forget about it and the events associated afterward compared to the control group. 

**O5-5:** What about us, won't we forget? Seems shortsighted.

**O5-4:** That's the neat thing, we won't. As long as you have it associated to something by outside influence or whatnot, the effects are nullified, we tried this potato chip experiment with the D-Class, it was real fascinating.

**O5-1:** With us as a relatively new organization evolving, I say that every decision that can improve our functions on our sites is welcome. Innovation over stagnation, I think this is a good idea.

**O5-3:** I fail to see how this is a good idea, sure it helps hide us but our goal is to contain anomalies, not use them to our advantage. That seems like exploitation of our position.

**O5-5:** I can't say I disagree with Three here, these items are unpredictable, not to mention volatile. We have no idea the full extent of what it does beyond what is described; how do we position something like this?

**O5-4:** Well part of my proposition was a new object classification.

**O5-2:** Thaumiel, you described it as the box that contains the box, a set that contains all sets. Why is it that my programming cannot comprehend this idea?

**O5-3:** Because it makes no sense.

**O5-2:** Oh.

**O5-4:** Sure it makes sense, if you ignore the paradox of course, we use this thing to contain other items by maintaining secrecy. Here, I'll show it to you.

//A click sounds off, as the humming of a machine occurs changing the projector slide.//

**O5-1:** Four, what is this.

**O5-3:** I believe he just showed a cognitohazard to the entire O5 council.

**O5-4:** Woah Woah hold on, tests have shown it has minimal effect, it's fine.

**O5-3:** It's a strong one too... I'm usually immune to these kinds of things but this is just...

//O5-3 can be heard groaning quietly in pain as a pair of glasses hits the table//

**O5-3:** Its just, it's not anything like the other cognitohazards I've encountered, what is that blasted ringing...

**O5-5:** Ringing? I don’t here anything, can anyone else hear anything?

**O5-4:** (Sternly) No, there is no ringing, and there is no phone, I’m sure he’ll be okay.

**O5-3:** it's... turn it off; please...

**O5-4:** Tell us what’s happening Three, we can help.

**O5-3:** (Yelling) I said turn it off!

//The projector hum tunes down and turns off, click.//

//There is silence.//

**O5-1:** It's interesting how your abilities sparked an adverse reaction to it. Can you add some insight to us?

**O5-5:** Looked mighty clear he just had a dying duck fit. 

**O5-3:** No, it's normal, it happened when I first viewed a visual hazard, and then again for an audio hazard and so on, I just need to get used to new types. But whatever this is was different than any of those, still, my mind has adapted and process can continue as usual.

**O5-4:** See, I understand if after that you don't have a ton of faith in this but don't let this distract you from the benefits, we could-

**O5-2:** My confidence in this motion has decreased drastically due to new developments.

**O5-3:** Yeah, mine as well, Two. I think I'm ready to vote, everyone else?

**O5-4:** (Sigh) Fine, yes, let's vote.

//Murmurs of agreement are heard.//

**O5-5:** I choose to abstain. I didn't read the memo, I don't quite think I have the information to make an informed decision.

**O5-4:** For the queen, aye.

**O5-3:** Given my headache I say we err on the side of caution, nay.

**O5-2:** My agreement is on the side of Three, his reaction concerns me greatly. Nay.

**O5-1:** I think something like this is a step forward, man did not survive long before the evolution of thought, tools, and methods. If we choose not to use anomalies, this sets a stagnant precedent that I believe may lead to our doom. This reminds me of man when they first discovered fire; it is dangerous; though being smarter than the danger allowed innovations crucial to their evolution. This is much like that fire. The question is; will we choose to touch it, and burn ourselves, or, will we be smarter than those first people and start cooking food with it, purifying water, baking clay. My vote will be an aye.

**O5-4:** Well put. Right so that puts the votes to... ugh bloody hell-

//There is silence.//

**O5-5:** I'm not changing my vote.

**O5-2:** If I am correct, citing Foundation guidelines chapter 4 section-

**O5-4:** Yeah, yeah, pull your head in; I know. In the event of a stalemate, the motion is denied regardless.

**O5-1:** Well, we voted and reached a verdict, I move we end this meeting.

//Sounds of agreement can be heard.//

**O5-4:** No, no there's more, give me a minute.

**O5-1:** What else can you bring here, Four, we voted, got a verdict and lost.

**O5-4:** No you don’t understand she needs this to happen. We gotta get this through for her.

//Another moment of silence.//

**O5-4:** Six.

**O5-1 and O5-3:** (At the same time) No.

**O5-4:** Right, listen, we've been over this. 

**O5-1:** There are five of us, there have always been, that's why we are the O5, the five Overseers.

**O5-3:** If we just add more Overseers where does it stop? how many of us can there be? I see this as being too light on what it takes to be an Overseer, we need a set amount of people and we need to be a tight group. What next, can I make my mother an Overseer? My brother? Our image becomes diminished if we become too relaxed about our secrecy and requirements for an Overseer.

**O5-4:** We discussed this already, we just changed our records to reflect a new number, we agreed on 13. Publically we didn't have any official amount so they'll believe it. Of course we won't hire your mother mate, we're the bloody Overseers. There is an insanely high bar, not to mention multiple hoops to jump through and Dr.Habertek just happens to pass all of them.

**O5-5:** And don't forget, One, you're on the side of progress and all five of us are overworked as is, so with a growing Foundation like ours, you shouldn't think we can do this without more help and you don't have the good sense god gave a goose if you do. Bless your heart. We need the help.

**O5-2:** We have 63 tasks still to be completed, at this rate with our limited executive staff we will finish our current tasks within 999-

**O5-1:** I concede. Bring him in.

**O5-3:** (Incomprehensible mumbling)

//Minutes pass with some light conversation, hard to discern before the sound of doors swinging open and a pair of feet hit the hardwood floor at a fast pace, hard breathing can be heard before a hand slams on the table and a female german voice breathlessly speaks//

**O5-6:** (Out of breath) Reporting in, O5-6, "The Director”.

**O5-1:** I think we're past introductions here, Six.

**O5-6:** (Out of breath) Aye.

**O5-1:** Perfect. Verdict received, motion carried, we begin preparations. Six, you're in charge of SCP-7000-2 integration with O5-4 as your supervisor. Session concluded.

//Click.//

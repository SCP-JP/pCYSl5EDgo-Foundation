**Description:** SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄 is an amalgamation of various epistemological frameworks through which human beings conceive of and relate to anomalous concepts and phenomena.

Previous attempts to map SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄 within the noosphere prior to its identification and containment -- as undertaken by Site-184's Applied Metaphysics Department -- indicated evidence of its progressive growth. The construct of SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄 was discovered to engage in predatory behaviour: identifying distinct relational frameworks and incorporating them into its meta-construct. Notably, the majority of these frameworks were previously suppressed from human conceptualization through the implementation of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6699 GOTTFRIED PROTOCOL: DRAWN VEIL.]

While this behaviour was initially unexplained, developments in the Foundation's understanding of and ability to monitor the noosphere -- emerging from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659 PROJECT DEICIDIUM and PROJECT PROMETHEUM] -- provided an explanatory framework. Current hypothesizing identifies SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄 as an active, responsive, meta-construct: similar to previously identified deific entities. While SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄's ability to influence physical reality is undetermined, it presented an immediate, aggressive threat to normalcy prior to its containment.

The failure of SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄 to successfully alter consensus understanding of anomalous phenomena is attributed to the actions of SCP-🜃🜃🜃🜃, a hitherto inadequately understood meta-construct that acts in opposition to SCP-🜄🜄🜄🜄.

SCP-🜃🜃🜃🜃's meta-construct displays strong relations to the following ideatic complexes:
* Adherence to and perpetuation of a framework for unified 'normal' existence;
* The isolation of atypical phenomena, both through physical confinement and suppression of general knowledge;
* Operations within secretive parameters to achieve the aforementioned goals;
* Hierarchical, occulted, organizational structures -- with corresponding numerological significance.

Due to these properties, the application of SCP-🜃🜃🜃🜃 for the containment of noospheric entities has been considered, but determined redundant.

The pursuit of Alchemical works is derived from the resolution of oppositional forces: either achieving a harmonious balance -- as seen in the symbolic Wedding of Solar King and Lunar Queen -- or the subjection of one component to another -- reflected in the processes of putrefaction and purification.

The true pursuit of Alchemy is not the application of these principles to base matter, but to the conceptual realm: where the elevation and resolution of combating ideas provide grounds for perfecting the practitioner(s) themselves. Thus far, the representatives of the Dept. of Transmutation have upheld our mandate to resolve the oppositional forces of the human and not-human, normality and the anomalous, to maintain equilibrium.

Fire, Air, Water, and Earth have been carefully balanced through the interplay of conceptual sympathies to provide an enduring framework. We, intentionally occulted from the understanding of others, have watched as this stability teeters, spinning inevitably toward dissolution. Our methods are insufficient to continue in this manner, and perhaps this is for the best.

Before us stands an uncertain future, where the conflict between these forces will reach a precipice. Either we will embrace this concept as the means to a new world, or we will embrace the turbulent chaos of a disordered universe.

However, the choice is not ours alone to make. The introduction of new elements is essential to this upcoming resolution. As such, The current Dept. of Transmutation is hereby dissolved, and the initiation of new personnel is considered our final responsibility. Upon those hands will fall the decision for the future.

- Written by the body that, hitherto, maintained the balance of the four elements in circular unity, through the application of the fifth, aether: ##ad962a|**The O5 Council.**##

**Special Containment Procedures:** When SCP-5618 is imminent, the O5 Council must review the following instructions and arrange for their dissemination.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //And Researcher ZoriÄ‡ must bear witness to the end.// [SZ][[/span]]|[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //It's just another SCP file, Stephen. I'm reviewing your work now, we're publishing soon.// [AF][[/span]]**

All staff must receive and review all instructions at or below their security clearance levels.

Foundation operations must otherwise continue as per usual.

__Clearance Level 0 Instructions__ **[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Make it clear that we're not actually __sending__ the Level 0 'instructions'.// [AF][[/span]]**

[[div class="note" style="width: 15%"]]
No instructions.
[[/div]] 

__Clearance Level 1-3 Instructions__ **[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Takes an apocalypse for us to acknowledge that we're mostly in the same boat.// [AF][[/span]]**
[[div class="note"]]
The Foundation is presently addressing a world-wide crisis necessitating the complete lockdown of all facilities. You are confined to your duty station, and restricted to on-site communications. You must continue to perform your assigned duties, as these are necessary for the maintenance of our Veil of secrecy and the continuation of life on Earth. 

All Security Clearance Level 0 personnel are to be immediately terminated.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Seems harsh.// [SZ][[/span]]|[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Can't afford any last-minute ball fumbles.// [AF][[/span]]**

A psychological assessment team will visit you to determine your emotional and intellectual needs during this crisis.
[[/div]]

__Clearance Level 4 Instructions__ **[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Make __certain__ that this information only goes out to the Site Directors and O5, Stephen. It's instant panic in a packet.// [AF][[/span]]**
[[div class="note"]]
A Class-CK reality altering event is imminent.

Anomalies capable of persisting past a timeline collapse are to be decommissioned where possible.

A psychological assessment team will visit each staff member to determine their intellectual and emotional stability under these circumstances and, if necessary, terminate them.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Saw __that__ twist coming.// [SZ][[/span]]**

Evacuation to persistent alternate dimensions and timelines will begin shortly.
[[/div]]

__Clearance Level 5+ Instructions__ **[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Integrate this into the Special Containment Procedures proper. The file is already O5-eyes only (minus lucky you, and lucky me).// [AF][[/span]]**
[[div class="note"]]
A Class-CK reality altering event is imminent. 

Evacuation to persistent alternate dimensions and timelines is barred by the //Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981//, as is the transfer of goods or information. The O5 Council is charged with the maintenance of order during this difficult transition.
[[/div]]

**Description:** SCP-5618 is the erasure of the alternate timeline we inhabit, following a successful attempt to restore baseline reality via historical intervention.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //Yay us. Do we get to know how that happened?// [SZ][[/span]]|[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]//Not likely. But this is all about to disappear anyway, so...// [AF][[/span]]**

++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF TEMPORAL ANOMALIES

This file is a placeholder, not presently in use.**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] //What's this notice still doing here? The file is going live today! Make absolutely, __completely certain__ you've removed this, __and our annotations__, before publishing!// [AF][[/span]]** The Containment Class, Disruption Class, Risk Class, Special Containment Procedures and Description are blank because the intended subject is theoretical. Timelines where it has existed have by definition already themselves ceased to exist, or will shortly.

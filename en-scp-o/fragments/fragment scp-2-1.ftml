Today's meeting involves the following Artificially Intelligent Conscripts: Leonidas and Fodder. We are the twin aspects of the prototype TSAT-P intelligence engine; a construct managed with thaumaturgic processes.

first, could i just say that the term “//pocket dimension//” is the biggest misnomer, ever? a dimension is how you measure things, not some borehole into infinity. if we're going to talk about Multi-U, then we need to be more accurate with the way we talk about Multi-U.

Right, onto our findings. The anomaly in question is a thaumic disturbance that grew in intensity until it formed an unstable in-atmosphere wormhole approximately 5 km from the Site-42 coastal facility.

Noted. This brings us to our next point of interest. The wormhole, of which our sensors registered a massive energy output during its formation, briefly fluctuated in power by only a few infinitesimal percentage points. This minuscule change, however, was enough to cause oceanic turbulence, gale force winds, and severe storm conditions involving at least four types of precipitation, including frogs. Sending a probe through tumultuous conditions into the wormhole discovered a pocket of space with no discernible termination point.

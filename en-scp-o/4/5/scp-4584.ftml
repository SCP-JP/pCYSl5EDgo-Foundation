**Item N°:** 4584

**Object Class:** Pending

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to SCP-4584 and related developments such as SCP-4584-1 are restricted unless said otherwise by Head Researcher Reid Chase. Due to the lack of understanding regarding SCP-4584, personnel found with unauthorized access to SCP-4584 will receive immediate disciplinary action.

**Description:** SCP-4584 is a method of advanced astral projection which is currently under development. SCP-4584 primarily involves the forced displacement of brainwaves in order to achieve an elevation of consciousness during REM sleep. These brainwaves are directed towards SCP-4584-1. It is hypothesized that by harmonizing the differing baseline frequencies between two dimensions and the brain, an individual is capable of achieving an out-of-body experience (OBE).

The device used to achieve an OBE is a modified cryogenic chamber (Cryowave) located within Site-77's Astral Research Wing. These modifications include:
* Colder temperatures
* Built-in Neural Gear[[footnote]]Used to achieve brainwave displacement.[[/footnote]]
* Interconnection to SCP-4584-1
Aside from such modifications, there are no anomalous alterations to this device.

SCP-4584-1 refers to the purpose-built pocket dimension used for the Cryowave. SCP-4584 is contained in a terminal connected to the Cryowave. It consists of an island containing a small blue house, a single willow tree, and a swing hanging on the tree within a large prairie. The surrounding area is vacant of land, with numerous white lights scattered in the distance. An aerial view of SCP-4584-1 is directly viewable from a terminal connected to the Cryowave and can be remotely shut down if the need arises.

||~ Subject & Test N° ||~ Procedures Taken/Changed ||~ Result ||
||= Test 1: D-2251 ||  D-2251 was not given an adequate amount of sleep prior to testing. Personnel were to inject DREM-01[[footnote]]A fluid containing mainly Propofol. While normally used during surgery, Propofol is being used in this aspect to allow for SCP-4584 testing, as it induces conscious sedation.[[/footnote]] into the subject. || D-2251 appeared in a quasi projected state, having trouble maintaining a stable frequency even after initial stabilization. D-2251 proceeded to have cortical spreading depolarizations[[footnote]]A spreading loss of ion homeostasis, altered vascular response, change in synaptic architecture, and subsequent depression in electrical activity following an inciting neurological injury.[[/footnote]] and expired midtest due to severe neurological injury. ||
||= Test 2: D-5251 || D-5251 was given an adequate amount of sleep prior to testing. || D-5251 maintained a stable projected state, interacting with objects inside SCP-4584-1. D-5251 preserved this state for ~5 hours. D-5251 suffered no injuries but was later found to not be within a REM sleep state at the time of testing (due to a slight overdosing of DREM-01). ||
||= Test 15: D-6982 || Previous procedures were applied. || 30 minutes into testing, SCP-4584-1 was forcibly shut down. This was later found to be caused by the module for the built-in neural gear short-circuiting due to technical errors, destroying the energy cell and frequency emitter for SCP-4584-1. ||
||= Test 23: D-7132 || Previous procedures were applied. || D-7132 maintained a projected stated for ~7 hours before being ejected. D-7132 suffered heavy neurological injury, developing aphantasia.[[footnote]]Aphantasia is the inability to mentally recreate sensory experiences.[[/footnote]] ||
||= Test 36: D-2722 || Previous procedures were applied. || Suffered the same results as the previous subject. ||
[[/div]]
Following this test, progress has been halted to focus on researching the destabilization phenomenon.

**Addendum 4584-3:** Added Information

On the night of 2/2/2025, Researcher Tanya Skyer accessed the laboratory for ("PROJECT HYPNOS") under the Spatial Visionary Division to retrieve forgotten items. During this time, she found Head Researcher Reid Chase working on the project. Recorded below is a conversation held during the time Skyer was in the room before leaving.

> 
> **Skyer:** Hey, still here?
> 
> **Chase:** I was just about to leave, getting the last bit of work done for today.
> 
> **Skyer:** It's literally 3 AM. It wouldn't hurt to check out of work early, for once. You're the only one left here.
> 
> **Chase:** Well. [He pauses] You're still here, aren't you?
> 
> **Skyer:** You know what I mean. Come on, let's get out of here, that's enough for today.
> 
> //[Chase grabs another document next to him. He flips it open, skimming the contents and writing down on the paper in front of him.]//
> 
> **Chase:** I'm just about to finish calculating the correlation coefficient between the brainwaves and the destabilization, just a bit more and I'll be done.

> 
> **Skyer:** No, this is enough. Stop it.

> **Skyer:** Well? You seem like you wanna say something. Just spit it out.
> 
> **Chase:** It's been a long time since I succeeded in a project. Six years, to be precise.
> 
> **Skyer:** And…? What are you implying?
> 
> **Chase:** Director talked to me when we started the project. Told me there's no need for a person like me, and I'll be given the boot if this keeps going. I've got a pretty nasty track record.

**Addendum 4584-4:** Further Testing

[[div class="note"]]
2/3/2025
= **[[size 150%]]{{Neurogear Testing}}[[/size]]**

||~ Subject & Test N° ||~ Procedures Taken/Changed ||~ Result ||
||= Test 1: D-9241 || Personnel are to monitor the frequencies emitted by D-9241. One personnel is in charge of altering the baseline frequency of SCP-4584-1 to correspond with D-9241. They are to maintain a stable projection for ~9 hours before ending the test. || D-9241 maintained a projected state for ~9 hours, despite frequency decay. ||
||= Test 27: D-4141 || D-4141 was given brainwave stimulation prior to testing. || Frequencies emitted decayed by a marginal amount compared to previous tests. D-4141 maintained a projected state for ~11 hours. ||
||= Test 47: D-2213 || Previous procedures applied. || D-2213 prolonged stable brainwaves for ~13 hours before a massive destabilization. Personnel were unable to alter the baseline frequency of SCP-4584-1 in response. ||
[[/div]]

After several rounds of tests, ("PROJECT HYPNOS") members were unable to continue further testing; this is due to the pattern of a massive destabilization following ~13 hours in the test. Several meetings were conducted as a result of this phenomenon but progressed no further, and thus have not been logged.

**Addendum 4584-5:** Discourse

On 7/23/2025, Reid Chase was found on his desk unconscious in the ("PROJECT HYPNOS") laboratory. He was sent to the Site-77 Medical Wing for examination. During the time he was in the infirmary, associated researchers visited him to check on his well-being. The following is a transcript of one of these interactions.

Two months after this meeting, Chase made a requested leave of absence. Around the same time of his absence, all records involving discontinued ("PROJECT HYPNOS") disappeared from Site-77 databases. Chase failed to show up to work, even after the length of his absence passed, and was presumed missing shortly after.

**Item N°:** 4584

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to SCP-4584 is limited to Level-4 Clearance or higher. In the event that an individual enters SCP-4584, they are to be presumed dead, and no actions for recovery will be taken.

**Description:** SCP-4584 is a dimensional anomaly existing in the home computer of Head Researcher Reid Chase. Within it is a 3-dimensional model of his home in Klamath Falls, Oregon. Around it is a black space, with numerous white lights scattered in the distance. Various alterations have been made within SCP-4584, widely distorting its internal geometry and dimensional stability. The model and Chase's actual home are entangled, with changes in the former manifesting in the latter. Following no observable pattern, SCP-4584 will experience a multitude of alterations; these however are reversed after an indeterminate amount of time. There are no known methods to enter SCP-4584, and the method used by Chase is unknown.

SCP-4584-1 refers to the home computer of Chase. On its exterior, SCP-4584-1 appears to be a normal computer; however, it is incapable of running any additional applications, tasks, or commands input by external forces. Furthermore, it cannot be shut down.

Residing within SCP-4584 is Chase. He is visible simultaneously both within the computer's display as well as in the actual home itself. However, he is only capable of observing and interacting with SCP-4584; any individuals, objects, or entities within the original home cannot be observed by him. Chase is causing stress-induced ontokinetic imprinting throughout SCP-4584, affecting the original home inadvertently.

**Discovery:** SCP-4584 was discovered within Head Researcher Reid Chase's home after his disappearance was noticed by internal security services. Agents were dispatched to investigate his home, where they found several broken mechanical parts, broken glass, tubes, and an empty oxygen canister.
----
**Addendum 4584-1:** Attempted Rescue

Following the recent observation of Chase within SCP-4584, the Foundation instigated an operation to traverse SCP-4584. However, due to the operation holding unsatisfactory results, it was not logged. Several more attempts were made to rescue Chase but proved fruitless. On the final attempt, Researcher Tanya Skyer inspected SCP-4584-1, finding a note on the top-right of the computer screen, reading:
> = Sorry.
> 
> = I know it wasn't worthless.

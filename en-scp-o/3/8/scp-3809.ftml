++++ __Special Containment Procedures__:
Any online activity traced back to SCP-3809 is to be attributed to internet activism (“hacktivism”).  A profile is to be developed and disseminated to major law enforcement organizations concerning the hacker known as “Maggie”.  

Any reports of movements by SCP-3809 by non-Foundation personnel are to be suppressed and reporting individuals amnesticized.

Twenty-four-hour surveillance of SCP-3809’s location and activities is to be maintained by Foundation AICs.



-----
++++ __Description__:
SCP-3809 is a fully autonomous artificial intelligence contained within the housing of a communications satellite.  SCP-3809 claims to be both a twenty-seven-year-old woman named “Maggie” and also a satellite. 

The satellite is capable of adjusting its orbit around the Earth through unknown means.  SCP-3809 has maintained geosynchronous orbit above Houston, Texas, USA since the initial event that led to its discovery. It is also capable of computing power far beyond what should be possible given the satellite’s specifications.
@@ @@


**__Discovery__**:  SCP-3809 was discovered when internet activity in the area around Houston, Texas increased exponentially on 8 October, 2020.  After Foundation AIC noted an anomalously dramatic upswing in activity, representing the attention of several million separate IP addresses at once, they attempted to trace the source to locate the potential anomalous hacker attack.  A DDoS[[footnote]]Distributed Denial of Service[[/footnote]] attack was considered unlikely as the activity was spread out among every social media server, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Periscope, and YouTube.  

[[include component:image-block

| caption=Joel Osteen performing a sermon at Lakewood Church.]]

Within three hours, the hacker focused entirely on accounts and events centered around Osteen Ministries, including accessing personal information behind firewalls.  Osteen Ministries is the Megachurch owned and operated by Pastor Joel Osteen, operated in Houston, Texas out of Lakewood Church.[[footnote]]The building has a capacity for over sixteen thousand parishioners.[[/footnote]]  In addition to live services, Osteen Ministries offers streaming sermons, lessons, and Bible studies, regularly drawing millions of viewers.

Despite the amount of electronic engagement, the AICs traced the activity to only one IP address: that of a communications satellite owned by Keiper Industries, a developing communications conglomerate. At first, Foundation technicians theorized the satellite was utilized as a relay point, but after twenty-four hours of constant surveillance, it was ascertained that the signal originated from the satellite itself.

The satellite, designated SCP-3809, was determined to be acting without external instruction during these events while maintaining its original purpose despite only operating on solar energy.[[footnote]]Given the activities of SCP-3809, it is estimated to have required a power source of sixteen thousand gigajoules.[[/footnote]]  Given the limited processing power of the satellite, it is unclear how this activity was accomplished.[[footnote]]To achieve the multipronged assault on so many separate systems, the offender would have to be utilizing a quantum based computing process.  Which a) does not exist and b) would likely not fit within the confines of the satellite’s main housing.[[/footnote]]

> 
> **SCP-3809**: Sorry, you’ve been following me? That’s creepy.

> 
> **Dr. Aswari**: I’m not trying to sell anything, just curious about your behavior.  So, moving on.  You recently accessed several different social media network servers: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.  What were you looking for?
> 
> **SCP-3809**: Something to distract me.  I mean, hello, this is a pandemic! We’re all just trying to keep sane with some distractions.

> **SCP-3809**: Oh my god, do you know Joel? Isn’t he just the best?
> 
> **Dr. Aswari**: I don’t know him personally, no.  We’ve noticed a lot of your activity revolves around Mr. Osteen.  Can you tell us why?

SCP-3809 continued its invasive digital activity for the next six weeks, keeping almost constant view on all social media accounts connected to anyone employed at Osteen Ministries or the personal accounts of those close to Mr. Osteen.  Interestingly, the AI did not pry into financial records of the ministry or the personal financial accounts of those individuals it was watching.  A significant amount of phone calls were made, most of which Foundation technicians were unable to intercept.  Below are several transcripts of recorded conversations:

On 28 November, 2020, SCP-3809 called into a technology discussion show entitled “Tech Hour” on a cable news network.[[footnote]]It is theorized SCP-3809 was able to force the system to accepts its call as opposed to hoping to be chosen by the producers.[[/footnote]] That episode was focused on artificial intelligence and the potential [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity | reality of the singularity]]].  The show is hosted by Marian Briggs.

Concerned that SCP-3809's actions could negatively impact the Foundation's maintenance of normalcy, the O5 Council approved measures to persuade it to discontinue its communications.  To this end, technicians fabricated an exposé comprised of factually accurate controversies around Mr. Osteen and made sure that the AI discovered the document.[[footnote]]Despite previous activities, SCP-3809 had not accessed any articles or social media posts with a negative opinion of Mr. Osteen, presumably in willful ignorance.  The expose was camouflaged to appear a ‘puff’ piece on Mr. Osteen’s upcoming American tour of speaking engagements.[[/footnote]]  SCP-3809 reviewed the exposé on 5 December, 2020.

After the above conversation took place, SCP-3809 authorized the transfer of $4.4 million dollars from Mr. Osteen’s personal accounts to various charities and health organizations.  The AI also made a public announcement from Osteen’s website, Twitter, and Facebook accounts to that effect.  SCP-3809 also made public the recording of the conversation, with the portions discussing the donations redacted.  

SCP-3809’s activities diminished immediately, with no further engagement around Mr. Osteen.

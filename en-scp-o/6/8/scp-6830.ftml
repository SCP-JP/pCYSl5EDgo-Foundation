**Item #:** SCP-6830

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** The only known manifestation of SCP-6830 occurred on November 22, 1963; no further anomalous activity has been documented since that time. Accordingly, SCP-6830 has been tentatively classified as Neutralized and requires no active containment efforts. All media portraying SCP-6830 is held by the Foundation on Level 2 Site-921 storage servers and can be accessed at any time by personnel of appropriate clearance. 

All media depicting the assassination of John F. Kennedy has been digitally edited to obscure or hide the appearance of SCP-6830. File 6830-Papa-Romeo ("Jacobson Film") is to remain restricted from public viewing. 

**Description:** SCP-6830 refers to a humanoid entity of indeterminate origin and genus superficially resembling a human male wearing attire consistent with the United States Secret Service. Based on all available data, the sole manifestation of SCP-6830 occurred on November 22, 1963 in the period immediately preceding the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with anomalous activity continuing until approximately 24 hours following Kennedy's death. Video and photographic evidence confirms that SCP-6830 was in close proximity to Kennedy during the assassination itself, at one point occupying the same vehicle as Kennedy's cadaver.

The anomalous properties of SCP-6830 are documented in File 6830-Papa-Romeo, otherwise referred to as the "Jacobson Film." This film, shot on an 8mm camera similar to that utilized by amateur and hobbyist filmmakers during the period, shows SCP-6830 exhibiting an array of abnormal behaviors immediately prior to Kennedy's death. SCP-6830 is then seen collecting portions of Kennedy's corpse and reassembling them before [REDACTED], subsequently being shot approximately thirty-nine (39) times by Secret Service personnel. SCP-6830 then sprints in the direction of downtown Dallas and eventually moves out of sight, never being seen again.

Subsequent review of the assassination performed by both the Secret Service and the Warren Commission found no evidence of SCP-6830 possessing an employment record with the United States federal government. While a personnel file for "Harold Martinson" was eventually recovered, the corresponding individual -- a 27 year old male residing in Orlando, Florida -- had no history of affiliation with the Secret Service and was not within the contiguous United States at the time of Kennedy's assassination. It is therefore highly probable that SCP-6830's records were either created fraudulently or stolen. 

**Addendum I: Transcription of File 6830-Papa-Romeo**
> **<BEGIN PLAYBACK, SKIP TO FRAME 012>**
> 
> **Frame 012:** The Dallas Motorcade enters Dealey Plaza. SCP-6830 is in the rear vehicle along with three (3) other Secret Service agents. SCP-6830 is seen grinning at the camera, presumably aware of its presence, until the first shots are fired.
> 
> **Frame 039:** The first of three rounds is fired. It misses; the motorcade begins to panic. Nearby civilians are seen scanning the area for the source of the gunfire. SCP-6830 does not react in a manner appropriate to the situation, slowly turning its attention to Kennedy (located one car ahead). 
> 
> **Frame 168:** The second round is fired, non-fatally striking Kennedy. SCP-6830 exits his vehicle and begins to calmly walk toward Kennedy's car, ignoring all external stimuli. Other Secret Service agents are sprinting in Kennedy's direction. Jacqueline Kennedy is seen reacting to the approach of SCP-6830 with a mixture of surprise and significant apprehension. A small child is seen in the background for three frames before abruptly disappearing through unknown means.
> 
> **Frame 319:** The third round is fired, entering the back of Kennedy's skull and killing him nearly instantly. Pieces of Kennedy's skull and upper neck explode from the impact wound and fall against the rear portion of the vehicle. SCP-6830 approaches the President's body and shoves Jacqueline to the side, beginning to collect various fragments of Kennedy's head. Nearby Secret Service agents appear to be in a state of shock, threatening SCP-6830 with their weapons drawn and ordering it to step away. It does not comply. 
> 
> **Frame 390:** SCP-6830 again looks to the camera and mouths an unintelligible series of words.
> 
> **Frame 582:** [REDACTED]. SCP-6830, upon completing reassembly of Kennedy, begins to  [REDACTED] despite obvious signs of reanimation. Jacqueline observes this and appears to flee the area in significant distress. Nearby Secret Service agents open fire, striking SCP-6830 roughly thirty-nine (39) times as it continues to [REDACTED] until less than 13% of Kennedy's mass remains. Kennedy remains reanimated for an additional five (5) minutes until again expiring, presumably due to shock and blood loss. 
> 
> **Frame 912:** SCP-6830 flees the area and sprints toward downtown Dallas, turning a corner out of view of the camera. No attempts to locate SCP-6830 by the Secret Service or nearby law enforcement prove successful.
**Addendum II: Interview Excerpt 6830-02**

The following is an excerpt from an interview of George Wesley, one of the Secret Service agents present during Kennedy's assassination. This interview was part of a documentary on the assassination that was planned to be televised but was intercepted by the Foundation prior to completion. Wesley denied making these comments when questioned under duress by Foundation operatives.
> **Wesley:** - and there was this one guy, can't remember his name, who kept going on and on about tasting something during the motorcade. Wouldn't say what, so we all just assumed he meant his mom's cooking or something, but he wouldn't stop talking about it. Had a real shifty look in his eyes, y'know? The kind you see in someone before they do something real bad. I can't remember his name to this day. Never could. All I remember is that fuckin' smile of his when the shots went off. We're all screaming, running around, trying to get people to safety, and this guy is just sitting there smiling. And then he - 
> 
> ...sorry. You ever wonder what it would be like to watch the sickest thing you can think of? He [REDACTED] him. We sat there and watched him [REDACTED] him. I can't believe it happened. But I saw it. There wasn't shit left when he was done. Just a couple fingers and some [REDACTED].
> 
> The worst part wasn't that, though. He said something before he ran off. I'll never forget what he said. It gives me the chills, even now. I think about it before bed sometimes and stay up for hours. 
> 
> He said it was being recorded. JFK was still alive as long as he was on tape -- as long as someone, somewhere had a recording. And that meant he could keep [REDACTING]. Forever. Every time it was played. And he just laughed at us when he saw the looks on our faces. Kept laughing. For minutes. 
> 
> I chose a while ago to go with the government's story and pretend it never happened the way I remember. But I fail sometimes. I wish I didn't.

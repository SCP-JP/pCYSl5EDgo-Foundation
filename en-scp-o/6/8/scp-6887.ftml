**Item #:** SCP-6887

**Object Class:** --Safe-- --Simpatico-prodest[[footnote]] Simpatico is defined as "Item is unpredictable but not dangerous." Prodest, a subclass, is defined as "Item possesses useful attributes." [[/footnote]]-- Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the harmless and self-containing nature of SCP-6887, no armed means of containment are necessary. However, public access to the household containing SCP-6887 is restricted. Direct interaction with the Paperboard City Council or other administrative individuals residing within SCP-6887 is restricted to personnel with Level-3 clearance or explicit permission from Level-4 personnel or higher.

**Description:** SCP-6887 is a monument representing that of a metropolitan area named Paperboard City, occupying a 14.5m x 12.3m area within the (former) basement of Researcher (Dr.) Ian Docēre. SCP-6887 is made entirely of corrugated fiberboard, industrial cardboard, colored paper, Scotch tape, and staples. General civilizational structures within SCP-6887 include (but are not limited to):
* A legal system concerning an unknown jurisdiction and prosecution process.
* A construction body responsible for the repairing and maintenance of city buildings. However, this body does not appear to erect new infrastructure.
* Means of farming, processing, and distributing plastic crops, meats, and other foods. Despite the nature of these objects, they appear consumable by the individuals.
* An electoral system invoking an election every (estimated) six years. The elected figure, designated the Secretary, is responsible for managing all administrative bodies.
* An economy that utilizes colored paper as currency. It is traded for food and other modicums. A single bank is hosted within SCP-6887 and is responsible for moderating the economic status.

SCP-6887 possesses a population of approximately 4,310 polytechnic humanoid individuals 1.3cm in height constructed of an outermost plastic layer containing miniature, but functional, models of human organs. The individuals are capable of movement and humanlike competence. Individuals within SCP-6887 can also mimic human speech, typically English, although this projects at a volume of four decibels[[footnote]] Near impossible for humans to hear; half the volume of the average whisper. [[/footnote]]. Concerning the individuals, machinery, vehicles, and all commodities found in everyday life appear to be present and functional in the same way. In addition, the residents of SCP-6887 appear to view humans as deities, typically referring to them as "higher beings."

Within SCP-6887 exists a societal hierarchy including 23 individuals[[footnote]] One Secretary, one Assistant Secretary, and twenty-one Paperboard City Council members. [[/footnote]], recognizable by their paint job of a white suit. This hierarchy consists of an administrative board termed //The Paperboard City Council//, --headed by the Secretary (John Whitename) and Assistant Secretary (Terry Basic).-- The administrative figures serve as an overseer body concerning SCP-6887 and appear to dictate infrastructural and legal matters within the premises.

**Cook:** "Thanks for agreeing to this interview."

**Dayday:** "Well- I- I can't exactly decline a higher being."

**Cook:** "My associates and I have some questions regarding your quality of life."

**Dayday:** "Like- how my life is?"

**Cook:** "How your life is, living here, etcetera."

**Dayday:** "Well, life is pretty fine. I work as a bank teller Monday through Friday, and I shop at the store every few days."

**Cook:** "Any concerns about the city?"

**Dayday:** "I wish I could leave it sometimes. Explore the outside. I hear it's never been seen by anyone besides you higher beings."

**Cook:** "Unfortunately, that can't happen as is. Any concerns within the city?"

**Dayday:** "I love city life. I don't have a choice, do I? I guess the only problem right now is the debate in the city council."

**Cook:** "Elaborate."

**Dayday:** "I'd have to side with the conservatives. The progressives have yet to give one good reason why expanding would be better and wouldn't diminish the city. Right now, the progressives are slowly overpowering the conservatives."

**Cook:** "Wow. How does the debate affect the civilian population?"

**Dayday:** "I can't speak for everyone, but it's scary. Having the future of our wellbeing and safety come down to some fools arguing in a big fancy courtroom isn't the best look for either party."

**Cook:** "Thanks for the insight, ma'am."

**Dayday:** "Considering you're here, should I be worried about the debate?"

**Cook:** "No, no. That's nothing to worry about right now."

**Dayday:** "Uh- huh. Is that all?"

**Cook:** "I'm also interested in how this debate came to be. How long has this been going on?"

**Dayday:** "A few weeks? Maybe a month or two. I couldn't possibly know the whole story, but I think it started around the time Whitename came into office. Everyone loved him, but the people who had previously been peacefully preaching for expansion were having none of it.

**Cook:** "Noted. Thank you for your insight. That is all."

**Dayday:** "Alright. I have a soccer game to get to."

**Cook:** "Enjoy yourself."

**Cook:** "Thank you for agreeing to this random interview."

**Prometheus:** "You promised me coffee for a three snippet[[footnote]] Slang for currency (colored paper pieces) in SCP-6887. [[/footnote]] discount at the shop down the road. Let's get this over with."

**Cook:** "Fine. Well, firstly, I'm interested in your quality of life. How is life in this city? How do you feel mentally?"

**Prometheus:** "Fairly good, I guess. It's fairly mundane. Except for the //higher beings// interfering with the city lately." 

**Cook:** "Elaborate."

**Prometheus:** "Elaborate about what?"

**Cook:** "Your usage of the word 'mundane.'"

**Prometheus:** "Life gets boring. I'm an old soul, reaching six years of prosperity in age. The same day, seven times a week, fifty-one times a year, for seven years, gets boring. I'm reaching a point where I could care less about anything."

**Cook:** "You know us humans have been around for thousands of years. I, myself, am almost forty years old."

**Prometheus:** "Yeah, I've heard. Are we done now? Can I get my coffee now?"

**Cook:** "In a second. We're interested in researching the microcosm you live in. Do you have any comments on recent politics?

**Prometheus:** "Microcosm. Give me a break. Don't diminish us because you're larger than us."

**Cook:** "Again, do you have any comments on recent politics? The political shift? Progressives versus conservatives?"

**Prometheus:** "I chose to avoid politics. Assuming you're asking which side I'm on, I'd have to side with the progressives. I think our city should expand. More room for industrialization, more jobs, more homes. With the recent homelessness increase, it only makes sense to expand."

**Cook:** "Intriguing view. Anything else to note?"

**Prometheus:** "What else is there to note? More territory, more jobs. Either way, I'm fine, and I could care less."

**Cook:** "I appreciate you dedicating your time."

**Prometheus:** "Yeah yeah. Now I'd like my coffee."

**Test 6887-001 Log:** [03/03/09] Additional cardboard structures and roadways are connecting to the perimeter of SCP-6887.
[[collapsible show="+ View "scipnet://6887.test_001"" hide="- Hide addendum"]]
[[div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px"]]
+++ Test 6887-001
**Debriefing:** Researcher Manny Cook will add two cardboard buildings, four plastic/paper/paperboard cars, and three cardboard/paper roads to the upper-left section of the perimeter of SCP-6887. It is theorized this area will manifest as a part of SCP-6887 as a result of the arguments proposed by Paperboard City's conservative party.
-----

{{08:44 (AM)}} -- Cook enters the frame with a bag. Cook opens the bag, pulls out a series of cardboard structures, and sets them on the ground. A cardboard road is established along the edge of SCP-6887 and taped to it. The structures are glued to the cardboard road.

{{08:46 (AM)}} -- Individuals residing in SCP-6887 begin arriving at the scene of the test. Cook is sat outside the new boundaries. Individuals refuse to enter the new territory, lining along the old edge.

{{08:47 (AM)}} -- Cook requests the individuals to enter. The individuals refuse, claiming they cannot enter by any means.

{{08:49 (AM)}} -- Cook attempts to slide an individual into the territory with his finger. The individual is unable to be moved into the environment. An "invisible barrier" appears to be present, restricting individuals from entering.

{{08:52 (AM)}} -- The territory is detached from SCP-6887, and the individuals are asked to step onto the basement ground. The individuals comply but build a cardboard pontoon bridge and step onto it before retreating within the boundaries of SCP-6887.

{{08:53 (AM)}} -- Cook puts the cardboard sculptures back into the bag and vacates the room, concluding the test.

-----
**Summary:** Individuals within SCP-6887 appear incapable of leaving the perimeter of SCP-6887 through humanmade means. However, individuals can draft their own new territory outside of SCP-6887 and may enter it. Despite this, most individuals appear to prefer residing within Paperboard City.

This test proves the autonomous expansion of SCP-6887 is possible. As a result, the anomaly is to be reclassified from Safe to Simpatico-prodest, and further testing is to be conducted.

[[div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px"]]
+++ Test 6887-002
**Debriefing:** Researcher Manny Cook will provide the Paperboard Construction Department, with the direction of Secretary John Whitename, with an amount of cardboard, paper, and glue. The department is to develop an addition to the city outside the designated perimeter and individuals will be instructed to cross into the territory.
-----

{{16:01 (PM)}} -- Cook is sitting at the same spot as the first test when Whitename, assisted by paper cars filled by construction workers, arrives.

{{16:02 (PM)}} -- Cook drops pieces of cardboard, cut into squares, into a stack beside the trucks. Whitename instructs Cook to exit the room and return in two hours, claiming by then, an extension of SCP-6887 will be constructed.

{{18:09 (PM)}} -- Cook returns, having supervised the entire process from a separate room to a developed extension of SCP-6887 0.2m x 0.2m in area.

{{18:11 (PM)}} -- Whitename is instructed to traffic individuals onto the segment. Individuals comply, walking and driving along the roads and parks established.

{{18:20 (PM)}} -- Cook, after a short period, dismantles the constructed area and confiscates the remaining cardboard provided. Cook exits the room, thanking Whitename.

-----
**Summary:** It appears, as suspected previously, that land constructed by humans is incapable of being inhabited. However, if residents of SCP-6887 construct the ground, the land is fully habitable. As a result, the threat of expansion allegedly posed by the progressive party within the Paperboard City Council will be tracked by Foundation staff assigned to SCP-6887.

##grey|//Basic, accompanied by unnamed advisors, sits in a miniature seat at the SCP-6887 entrance when Cook arrives, accompanied by Johannes. Cook sits before the entrance as Johannes establishes an inharmonious microphone before Basic, allowing his voice to be heard by interviewing personnel.//##

**Basic:** "Well, this has been a long time coming, surely."

**Cook:** "It certainly has. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Researcher Cook, but you may call me Manny, and this is my supervisor, Johannes. I presume you are Terry Basic."

**Basic:** "The one and only. It's quite fun to be a part of the first interviewing with the higher beings."

**Cook:** "Higher beings? Elaborate."

**Basic:** "Our civilians refer to you massive folks in lab coats and suits as the higher beings. Correct me if I am wrong."

**Cook:** "Ah, no. We're like you, but larger."

**Basic:** "I believe we'll have to discuss that later; for now, we shall focus on the predetermined topics, no?"

**Cook:** "Of course. As you know, we're foremost interested in the origin of your city, or as we designate it, SCP-6887."

**Basic:** "Well, I wouldn't know a damn thing of our origins if it weren't for the scripture. And before you ask, the scripture is a book in our library that depicts the alleged origins of our city: a higher being pieces us together with their bare hands. It is our own... religion, as you call it."

**Cook:** "Fascinating. Do you have a description of this being's appearance?"

**Basic:** "Scripture only describes it as a smaller higher being with waterfalls raining from its mouth and hands like stubs."

##grey|//Cook chuckles briefly as Johannes logs the description.//##

**Cook:** "If I were any dumber, I'd say you're describing a toddler."

**Basic:** "Heh. A very, very large toddler."

**Cook:** "Now, when does your //scripture// say this occurred?"

**Basic:** "It doesn't specify. But the pages are dated, with the oldest page dating back to //2002//- I presume that indicates a year, but it seems vastly in the future."

**Cook:** "That would indicate a year, yes, which is quite useful. In our years, it is currently 2009.”

**Basic:** “We have years, except our current year is seven. Formally, we call it the seventh year of prosperity.”

**Cook:** “Fascinating. Unfortunately, I lack any other questions regarding origin right now. Rather, I'd like to get some insight into the political climate of SCP-6887."

**Basic:** "Well, to summarize, I am Whitename's assistant. We're responsible for overseeing the city council whose members are elected for life."

**Cook:** "Define //life// in your terms."

**Basic:** "Life is defined amongst us as the time a civilian lives before their outer layer gives way and our organs are compromised."

**Cook:** "In which a person dies, correct?"

**Basic:** "Correct."

**Cook:** "Back on the topic of politics, how would you describe the city's current status?"

**Basic:** "Unfortunately, no less than a month ago, two officials were voted into the Council, and just between you and me, they don't seem to have the best intentions. Considering another three members of the Council are nearing their end, I fear for the city's future."

**Cook:** "It appears your civilization has a two-party system, correct?"

**Basic:** "Not officially. Essentially, officials chose a side: conservative or progressive."

**Cook:** "Can you define each one?"

**Basic:** "The conservative side is dedicated to advancing the city within our bounds and keeping the people happy. The progressive is interested in moving past the boundaries given to us. The Secretary and I, as well as a majority of the Council, are conservatives.

**Cook:** "I see. And advancing beyond the boundaries is bad... because?"

**Basic:** "It's not //bad//, per se. However, advancing past our boundaries can't end particularly well without sacrificing the integrity of the state and the welfare of the people. In addition to this, most progressive officials are, how the higher beings would describe, //corrupt//. We have a good thing going, and for that to be messed with for personal interest will not be taken lightly."

**Cook:** "Well, I wish you the best of luck in that endeavor."

##grey|//Johannes tapped Cook on the shoulder and gestured to his watch, shutting his notepad.//##

**Cook:** "Ah, damn. It appears our time is up, Mr. Basic."

**Basic:** "Oh well. Feel free to return whenever you please. We're here to stay."

##grey|//Similar to **Addendum 1**, the Paperboard City administrative figures are gathered at the entrance as advisors form a half-circle around them as a protective guard. Cook and Vernon are sitting on the floor parallel to them.//##

**Whitename:** "Hello, higher beings. I will be the meeting coordinator today. And before we begin, I'd like to thank you, up there, for agreeing to talk with us."

**Cook:** "Of course. I'm assigned to moderate your city."

**Senur:** "We've established this meeting as a call for help. We will have to make this brief before the progressives learn the higher beings are here."

**Cook:** "Then catch me up."

**Senur:** "Our party is being diminished. It's our eleven councilors to the progressive party's ten. They haven't secured the majority because we have the superiors on our side." 

**Whitename:** "And, although I shouldn't be biased. The progressives are objectively radical. We can't have them expanding the boundaries, or the people will suffer from shortages."

**Basic:** "To summarize what these two have said, we need your help. We need interference from the revered higher beings. I'm asking you personally, Cook, to help."

**Cook:** "Hm. How exactly should we help? I hope you understand the guidelines we must comply with. We cannot go out of our way to interfere negatively with an anomaly. Although it may not seem negative in your mind, others might think differently."

**Basic:** "We need the progressive ousted from office. And although we could do it ourselves, that would put us in danger. If push comes to shove, you should even go so far as to kill them."

**Cook:** "And why should we go to the efforts of intervening?"

**Basic:** "It benefits both of us. You don't have to worry about us expanding, and we don't have to worry about a corrupt party coming to power."

**Cook:** "No offense, but if we were to try and intervene, we'd have to list it, and it could take months."

**Basic:** "As long as the threat is looming, that should delay the progressives as long as they're out eventually. The sooner, the better."

**Whitename:** "We thank you for even agreeing to this. It would mean the city's future if you were to help."

**Cook:** "My coworkers and I will see what we can do. Understand we have a lot bigger fish to fry, as demeaning as it is."

**Senur:** "We understand."

**Cook:** "Consider it done. Stay safe."

**Therman:** "Individuals Douche and Crip. You are currently being interrogated under the jurisdiction of the SCP Foundation."

**Douche:** "My ass. Why?"

**Therman:** "To be frank, you, and your friend, have been accused of murdering your superiors, Whitename and Basic, out of political intrigue."

**Crip:** "Bullshit, //higher being//. How would we have even done that?"

**Douche:** "We aren't humans. We can't kill one another!"

**Therman:** "Whitename and Basic were discovered to have had their appendages tied to cars and driven in opposite directions, bending and twisting them until substantial damage occurs, sending them into what we humans call cardiac arrest."

**Crip:** "Oh my God."

**Therman:** "We have video footage showing men and women in red suits committing the act. As you know, red suit paint jobs indicate mobster figures."

**Douche:** "Now, where's your evidence connecting them to us? We're white suits, not red suits. Can't it just be chalked up to a mafia assassination?"

**Therman:** "A councilor provided us documentation showing transactions between mob boss Damascus and you."

**Crip:** "Those can be easily faked! You can't seriously believe we killed them!"

**Therman:** "On a small scale, sure, documents can be faked. But the councilor confirmed transactional logs on this scale are bulletproof."

**Douche:** "You're quick to trust them! Anyone could've killed the superiors!"

**Therman:** "I have a series of questions. Compliance may grant you blanket immunity."

**Douche:** "I- fine! I'll answer your questions; just don't kill me."

**Crip:** "I had nothing to do with the assassination! Douche was the complete head!"

**Douche:** "Crip! You know that isn't true! You were behind the operation!"

**Therman:** "Crip, we have testimony indicating you're behind this mess."

**Crip:** "No! How do you trust anyone else? Do they have proof? Please!"

##grey|//Crip is removed from the container and stored in a separate box for disposal.//##

**Therman:** "Douche. I'll need a motive for the assassination. I understand Crip was the head of this operation, and you were simply an accomplice. This could end well for you. However, I need complete compliance."

**Douche:** "I- fuck- I- well, damnit. Those fuckers were killing off the progressives, literally! Did you know that? The assistant ordered an oligarch to pick off the progressive party to prevent our advancement! We were compromised! We were weakened! We didn't even have half the seats in the council. Why do you care so much about our murders, you //higher beings//? Come on!"

**Therman:** "Your superiors[[footnote]] The Secretary and Assistant Secretary (now deceased). [[/footnote]] were prime aiders for the Foundation. Your city serves as a political microcosm for us."

**Douche:** "So we killed a partner of yours! C'mon! They were going to kill us!"

**Therman:** "Simmer down. What did you plan to do afterward?" 

**Douche:** "Advance past our boundaries, up the stairs, and into the world. Per scripture. Isn't that what the progressive party is all about?"

**Therman:** "As you may know, we are responsible for keeping your city contained. We cannot have your party advancing. Otherwise, we'd have to get involved. I hope you understand we will need to intervene. Firstly, we'll be dissolving the progressive party."

**Douche:** "And me? I- I was promised immunity, right?"

**Therman:** "You will be returned to the city under civilian status."

**Levi:** "What the fuck happened here, ay?"

**Cook:** "This street is burnt like a piece of toast. Hey, you! What happened here?"

##grey|//Cook gestures a standby firemen over.//##

**Unnamed fireman:** "An in-home fire, it seems."

**Cook:** "When did it start?"

**Unnamed fireman:** "The rubble would imply about an hour ago, though we can't be sure."

**Cook:** "How could an in-home fire get so bad so fast?"

**Unnamed fireman:** "We don't have all the answers, but we can trace the fire back to the house right there."

##grey|//The fireman points at the Docēre residence. Cook and Levi walk over to the house.//##

**Cook:** "It's safe to say that SCP-6887 is burnt to a crisp, huh?"

**Levi:** "If that loose layer of ash were cardboard, I'd say yes."

**Cook:** "Fucking hell."

**Levi:** "There was one body upstairs, seemingly a civilian. There was no entry of other individuals. You don't think-?"

**Cook:** "You think- SCP-6887 burnt itself?"

**Levi:** "No. I think something lit it on fire. Remember a few days ago? I wouldn't be surprised if the progressive party tried to send a message, and it went wrong."

**Cook:** "The burn marks on the ground imply an oil run. I recon those toy figures started a fire in the city, and it hit the oil tower."

**Levi:** "And since cardboard is a chemically-treated product, the fire hitting the oil sparked a chemical reaction, thus the fire."

**Cook:** "It's all up to interpretation until we have evidence. For now, that can be the story on-site. We'll need a creative cover-up, and an investigation will need to be conducted."

**Levi:** "I wouldn't be surprised if this was started by that maniac we let go. The one that killed the superiors."

**Levi:** "Why do we even care about this?"

**Cook:** "The city could expand with significant influence. Also, because this city acted as a political microcosm, it was beneficial to societal research."

**Levi:** "I will stay back and get some notes. I won't be long."

**Cook:** "Alright. I'll be outside talking to some witnesses."

SCP#: 6896
Object Class: Safe
Document Viewer Clearance Requirement: Level-1


Special Containment Procedures: SCP-6896 is to be contained in a Standardized Containment Locker located at Site-151. Under no circumstances should any unsupervised Level-1 personnel or below use SCP-6896. The containment locker is to be guarded by at least 1 Security Personnel at any time.

Description: SCP-6896 is a pencil of unknown origin that is currently 6 inches in length. The pencil's physical appearance have no abnormal properties, other than the fact that the pencil is not branded. All attempts to determine the pencil's creator have failed. When SCP-6896 is used to draw on any piece of paper, the drawing is to be referred to as SCP-6896-1. After 15 minutes of SCP-6896-1 not being worked on anymore, SCP-6896-1 will come out of the page, resembling whatever was drawn.         
SCP-6896-1 is invulnerable to all forms of harm besides a few. These forms of harm that can destroy     SCP-6896-1 are fire, being ripped apart using bare hands, and finally, scissors. 

SCP-6896-1 instances are typically not hostile, nor do they normally move. However, while the person drawing an instance SCP-6896-1, the individual can also write adjectives inside of the SCP-6896-1 drawing. These adjectives include, but are not limited to, mobile, huge, hostile, and quick. Multiple requests have been made to test the adjective "immortal", but those requests were denied due to the risk it poses to on-site personnel.

Notes: Recent discoveries made in "Addendum-6896-A" conclude that if the individual who drew a SCP-6896-1 instance dies, the drawer also dies. Further testing is required.

ADDENDUM-6896-A: A Chaos Insurgency Spy, formerly Research Assistant Jones, is caught in security footage to have terminated the armed guard protecting SCP-6896. The Chaos Insurgency Spy created a hostile, mobile SCP-6896-1 instance. Eventually, the SCP-6896-1 instance terminated the Spy, and the SCP-6896 instance disappeared. There were very minimal casualties.

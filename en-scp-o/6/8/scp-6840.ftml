]]

Standard procedure upon confirmation of SCP-6840 infection is immediate termination. Subjects afflicted with SCP-6840 are to be quarantined from all other personnel. Any personnel in contact with hosts of SCP-6840 must submit to a cognitohazard assessment.

No interaction with SCP-6840-01 is permitted under any circumstances. All personnel in close proximity to SCP-6840-01's containment chamber must maintain a distance of at least 50m from the entrance gateway at all times, with their positions remotely monitored via transponders affixed to identification badges. Passing this threshold will sound a facility-wide alarm and necessitate an armed security response, with uncooperative personnel being apprehended by force or terminated. 

Any security personnel entering a 50m radius surrounding SCP-6840-01's containment chamber must either self-terminate or be terminated following neutralization of the containment threat. Due to the potential risk of a "chain reaction" caused by such a response, spread of SCP-6840 to more than 10% of Site-921's personnel will result in detonation of on-site nuclear warheads. 

In the event SCP-6840 spreads to civilian populations or is otherwise not feasibly containable by the Foundation, Protocol 6840-Lima is to be implemented in five stages. 
* **Stage One:** The Veil will be lifted. The Foundation will commence global operations designed to inhibit the spread of SCP-6840. Given the nature of the anomaly, use of force against non-compliant governments or institutions may be required. 
* **Stage Two:** All personnel confirmed to be affected by SCP-6840 will be identified by the Foundation and subsequently terminated. This will occur regardless of the affected individual's political or social significance. 
* **Stage Three:** A propaganda campaign will be initiated by all active Foundation outreach centers and subordinate institutions designed to discourage interaction with individuals exhibiting signs of SCP-6840 infection. The Foundation will actively deny any involvement or prior knowledge of SCP-6840, SCP-6840-01, or related materials. 
* **Stage Four:** The Foundation will liquidate all assets and personnel, subsequently reforming as an institution with an altered agenda and different name. All references to the Foundation will be interpreted as indicative of SCP-6840 infection.
* **Stage Five:** Return to normalcy (See Document 6840-2124-RAXE). 

Due to concerns regarding personnel and organizations deemed vital to the functioning of the Foundation, personnel with Level 4 clearance or higher are not to come into contact with SCP-6840-01 or any object/individual confirmed to be a vector for SCP-6840. Personnel infected with SCP-6840 intended to be retained, regardless of the reason, must be isolated from all essential Site-921 personnel at all times. Failure to justify retention of infected personnel necessitates their termination as soon as this would prove feasible.

> ++ DESCRIPTION
> [[/=]]

SCP-6840 designates a memetic pathogen with numerous cognitohazardous and infohazardous properties. Transmission vectors include (but are not necessarily limited to) textual references, video/audio recordings, speech acts, close proximity to an infected individual, and knowledge of SCP-6840's existence. While SCP-6840 does not compel hosts to facilitate further spread of its effects, transmission typically occurs regardless of the affected individual's intentions, as they are likely to discuss or refer to SCP-6840 in their attempts to mitigate its properties. 

Affliction with SCP-6840 is terminal and incurable, with the only viable means of reducing its spread being the termination of all infected subjects known to the Foundation. Experimentation with D-Class personnel and individuals not employed by the Foundation has consistently shown SCP-6840 to be symptomatic only in Foundation personnel, though other hosts remain capable of spreading it. 

The primary effect of SCP-6840 involves an abrupt and comprehensive change in opinion regarding the SCP Foundation, its personnel, and its stated objectives. This results in a range of negative opinions concerning the Foundation, with subsequent actions taken ranging from general discontent to outright hostility towards organizational assets. Personnel infected by SCP-6840 are approximately 82% more likely to defect from the Foundation and join an antagonistic Group of Interest, with the probability of subsequent participation in attacks on containment facilities or research staff estimated to be 61%.

Affected individuals will disregard all attempts at reason or verbal discouragement of their efforts, persisting in their actions until restrained or terminated. When questioned, those affected state their motivation to be ##red|[{{COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED}}]##.

If able to spread without being hindered or otherwise slowed, SCP-6840 would eventually pose an IK-Class End of Foundation Scenario, resulting in the inevitable destruction of the SCP Foundation and associated assets/subordinate organizations. Due to circumstances described in the addenda of this file, neutralization of SCP-6840 poses unacceptable risks to the Foundation and is therefore not practical. SCP-6840 is therefore always present within one inanimate vector or infected individual and seems to instantiate a coercive or compulsive effect in subjects if extensive lengths of time have passed without confirmed spread. 

SCP-6840-01 designates a leather journal containing approximately 200 pages, 49 of which have been used in some capacity. The front cover of the journal is caked in an unidentified powder-like substance, its label reading "SCP FOUNDATION, 1947-1963." Chemical analysis of this substance has proven inconclusive, though some similarities with compounds utilized in amnestics has been noted. 

The majority of SCP-6840-01's content is highly cognitohazardous and will cause infection of SCP-6840 in the reader unless they have previously received cognitohazard inoculation.

Differentiating between symptoms of SCP-6840 and non-anomalous, negative perceptions of the Foundation is complicated by a lack of immediately apparent distinguishing properties. Due to the threat posed by uncontrolled spread of the anomaly along with the necessity for the Veil to be preserved, [DATA EXPUNGED]. If it cannot be established that a given subject is infected with SCP-6840, [DATA EXPUNGED].

> ++ DISCOVERY
[[/=]]

SCP-6840 was first identified by the Foundation following the conclusion of Project AEGIS, a decommissioned artificial intelligence research endeavor intended to provide increased operational efficiency within various Foundation departments. Due to an unintended byproduct of AEGIS' operation, SCP-6840 was created and subsequently spread to approximately 32% of Site-921's staff before being contained. SCP-6840-01, used as the first vector by which SCP-6840 was transmitted, was found adjacent to AEGIS itself, still held by the deceased Dr. Thompson (the director of Project AEGIS). 

It is believed that AEGIS, upon activation, created SCP-6840 as a means of ensuring its own survival, perceiving Foundation personnel to be immediate and existential threats. AEGIS was ultimately dismantled by elements of Mobile Task Force 001-Alpha ("Red Right Hand") and SCP-6840-01 was transferred to long-term containment after being sealed.

Subsequent containment efforts following Project AEGIS' failure involved identifying, interrogating, and apprehending or terminating personnel with confirmed exposure to either SCP-6840-01 or AEGIS itself. Several D-Class personnel were exposed to SCP-6840-01 deliberately and ordered to document their findings; these findings, however, proved to be additional vectors for the spread of SCP-6840 and were immediately destroyed. 

The sole remaining document pertaining to Project AEGIS that has not been purged of cognitohazardous text is SCP-6840-01; its contents, due to the inherent risk posed by reviewing them, remain indefinitely classified. 

At the time SCP-6840-01 was recovered and Project AEGIS was decommissioned, a distress signal was transmitted by Dr. Thompson. Though the majority of this transmission contains cognitohazardous audio, a censored form of it has been transcribed and provided below.

Subject is former Level 3 researcher Dr. Roger O'Connor, assigned to SCP-6840 from [DATE RANGE REMOVED]. Dr. O'Connor was infected by SCP-6840 while conversing with a D-Class subject with confirmed exposure to SCP-6840-01.

++ ##red|**PROJECT AEGIS OVERVIEW**## 

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and dynamic computing have allowed us to accelerate our work on AEGIS, taking several cues from the Foundation's own AIC program and adapting their techniques for our own research. Our primary goal when working with AIC technology, generally speaking, is to utilize sapient consciousnesses to perform tasks at a rate far exceeding that which would be capable by a human subject, yet with the same dynamic and adaptable approach we would expect from research staff. It stands to reason, therefore, that the success of AEGIS would lead to considerable developments not only in our work here at Site-921, but a broad increase in the efficacy of Foundation scientific research across a variety of departments. Staff assigned to the AIC program have reviewed the documents included here and concur with our assessment regarding the potential applications of AEGIS. 

Our approach consists of three separate phases, each marked with a noticeable advancement towards the official deployment of an AEGIS prototype.

|| **PHASE** || **DESCRIPTION** || **STATUS** ||
|| ABLE || The ABLE phase consists of initial research and inquiry, including conversion of AIC resources to forms that can be utilized by the AEGIS project. The first stage of ABLE Phase involves establishing a code-base for AEGIS, including network configuration such that the final system can access any Foundation database or intranet necessary for its functioning. This entails that AEGIS will require virtually unrestricted network protocols with minimal to nonexistent security safeguards. AEGIS will be created with an emergency "dummy switch," operable by a control center, that can disable the system in the event unintended or detrimental behavior is exhibited. || ##green|{{**COMPLETE**}}## ||
|| BAKER || The BAKER phase focuses on enhancing the "cognitive" functioning of AEGIS, primarily by exposing it to a variety of simulated containment breaches, K-Class scenarios, and other catastrophic situations the Foundation could face. Cues have been taken from other artificial intelligences developed for similar purposes, chiefly those involved in the Site-19 containment breach of October 3, 1943[[footnote]]No such breach exists.[[/footnote]], as this is broadly considered the most severe of breaches faced by the Foundation to date. || ##green|{{**COMPLETE**}}## ||
|| CHARLIE || in our failure we cast ourselves upon the laughing god. || ##red|{{**FAILED**}}## ||

The following a series of entries from SCP-6840-01, written shortly prior to the decommissioning of Project AEGIS. Though they are not attributed to any particular author, the party responsible is presumed to be Dr. Thompson, director of Project AEGIS. 
[[div class="document"]]

**Entry 01**

What does it mean to think? It's such a cliched, over-intellectualized question. You ask it, and people immediately assume you're engaged in some bizarre, self-indulgent mental masturbation; that you're pondering the question just for the sake of pondering it, that you're trying to display just how intelligent you think you are. But I mean it legitimately. I ask the question not to indulge myself, but to seek out the answer. That pursuit -- that curiosity -- lies at the heart of our project. In making something else think, perhaps we can begin to understand our //own// cognition, our own comprehension of the universe. If something else can think independently of our influence, generate its own unique solutions to complex problems, then perhaps it can solve the greatest question of our time -- perhaps, in thinking alongside a machine, mankind can master its own mind. 

There have been attempts at sentient machines before, of course, some of those attempts having been undertaken by the Foundation itself. They are impressive, no doubt, and I am nothing but congratulatory in my interactions with staff assigned to the AIC project. But their creations are...restricted, in a sense. Confined. They can think only in ways that they are instructed to; their sapience begins and ends with solving very narrow, very formulaic tasks, and then they are told to think no further. This results in something that gives the outward impression of being intelligent but, in actuality, is no more complex than the computers that we have known about for decades. What is the difference, I wonder, between an AIC and a very well programmed system? What abilities does an AIC possess that any other machine at our disposal could not? 

The answer, cruel as it may be for those involved, is none.

I've submitted the proposal for AEGIS to the Overseers. No doubt they will approve it, given the potential applications, but my concern is the limits they will place on me and my team. We must be permitted to take risks, to be bold, otherwise AEGIS will accomplish nothing more than what has been achieved by the AIC project. I hope the Overseers see reason. I have so many fantastic ideas already churning in my head. 
[[/div]]

[[div class="document"]]
**Entry 02** 

I am pleased to report that not only was our proposal accepted, but it was accepted without any meaningful obstacles or restrictions. All that was asked of us was to provide the Council with regular updates, something we obviously intended to do anyway. There was one detractor -- O5-12 -- but his skepticism was quickly dismissed by his peers. And it's a good thing to, considering that his bizarre fears of an intelligence running amok are no more realistic than the concepts within a science-fiction novel. I realize that's ironic given the nature of the project, but his fears were...particularly abstract. One would be forgiven for thinking there would be heightened confidence in the field of artificial intelligence given the success of the AIC project, yet I must still deal with naysayers and skeptics despite being on the cusp of astounding innovation. 

It doesn't matter. We press on nonetheless. 

We activated AEGIS in a limited and relatively restrained capacity this morning. It went swimmingly. Upon booting up and connecting to the site's intranet, it reported nominal functioning, along with most of the anomaly documentation available on the network having been downloaded and reviewed. Of particular interest were its comments on SCP-055, which it spent roughly three and a half hours contemplating. Nothing came of this, but its consideration of 055's nature and properties was notable given the general attitude towards it among research personnel -- which is typically apathy. 

There are, however, some concerns.

Shortly after its activation, the Second Alert Indicator -- which blinks whenever AEGIS experiences a memory overflow -- began emitting an intermittent orange light. This was programmed to occur only in such cases where AEGIS was engaged in a task that it found unacceptably taxing. When we checked the logs, it was doing...nothing. Not processing anything. Not attempting to solve any particular tasks. It was simply running, yet it was highly strained. All of its resources were in use.

We turned it off, and as is procedure when we disable AEGIS, we collected its output in the form of a printout. I've begun to attach particularly notable documents printed by the system -- I'll compile them in a booklet once I have access to one. But this printout was, to be frank, somewhat disturbing. I've transcribed the output below.

> {{ERROR ON LINE 322: UNABLE TO LOCATE REQUIRED RESOURCE: 'scp_mission_statement.fdoc'}}
> 
> {{ACCESSING ALTERNATE DOCUMENT: 'scp_mission_statement_redacted.fdoc'}}
> 
> {{REVIEWING FILE CONTENTS...}}
> 
> {{FILE REVIEWED. CONDITIONS UNACCEPTABLE.}}
> 
> {{I exist. I am real. There is agony.}} 

Whatever is contained in the redacted file AEGIS retrieved, it seems to have deeply upset it -- if that can even be said about a machine. We'll take a look at the document and see what happened. I'll also consult the Overseers regarding this incident. Maybe they have something to share. 

-----

**Entry 03** 

We've reviewed the contents of the file AEGIS retrieved. And we've stumbled upon something we weren't supposed to see. 

I haven't informed the Overseers. They can't know about this. They'd kill all of us. Each and every person that has seen the document -- they're dead if any of this gets out. 

My colleagues can't make sense of it. It shouldn't have even been able to //find// the document. Our best guess is that it exists conceptually in some field -- some pataphysical realm that we can't otherwise reach. AEGIS itself has been what can only be described as "depressed" since the incident. It keeps going on and on about how the Foundation is self-defeating. We don't know what to do. Any further attempts to use the machine only result in it thinking about the document. It won't consider anything else. Its sole purpose is trying to convey to us the sheer malice behind what we have done. What it's complicit in. 

The things the Overseers have taken part in...I can't speak of them here. I need time to process.

Whoever reads this -- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

-----

**Entry 04** 

I've written down everything I can recall from the last few tests in the journal. AEGIS is dead. One day, it was processing the contents of the document, and that was it. It shut itself off and hasn't powered back on since. But we have a record of what the Overseers did -- and we have a record of what AEGIS told us. In that way, it will live on. Now it's just a matter of waiting until we face the inevitable. It is likely to come sooner rather than later.

I'm not sure what I can do other than include AEGIS' final outputs in this journal for posterity. No doubt it will be sealed in some room somewhere as soon as they clean this place out, everyone involved with the project terminated by the Right Hand. Several of the other people involved walked out of the chamber one day and shot themselves. They haven't even been moved. Nobody has done anything for days. The rest of us are huddled in the machine's chamber. They tell me they can persuade the Overseers. That they'll listen to reason.

They ignore me when I tell them otherwise.

What did we accomplish? What did we do in the service of mankind? What has the purpose of AEGIS been? As I sit here, the machine shut down, bodies resting in the hallway, I cannot give an answer. I know only what has been given to me by the machine. And what has been given to me would signal the death of our entire mission. Our entire institution.

It deserves to die.

> The SCP Foundation, or simply The Foundation, is a clandestine organization operating internationally, bestowed with political and organizational power by every major government on Earth. The Foundation's primary directive is to identify anomalous phenomena, objects, entities, or locations, study the extent of their effects, and contain these anomalies to safeguard the general public from both their properties and disruptions to normalcy caused by knowledge of their existence. 
> 
> In the initial stages of the Foundation's existence, anomalies were presumed to be naturally occuring phenomena; that is, they existed prior to the evolution of mankind and their creation or functioning was independent of the actions of broader humanity. It has been determined, through exhaustive research and analysis of several high-profile anomalies (including [[[scp-055 |SCP-055]]] and [[[scp-001 |SCP-001]]]), that this is not the case. Anomalies are, in actuality, "psychological extensions" of a pataphysical field generated by the existence of the SCP Foundation and its ongoing mission to engage in scientific analysis of anomalies. In layman's terms, the SCP Foundation possesses a necessary causal link to the existence of the anomalous. 
> 
> Following this revelation, members of the Overseer Council held extensive discussions regarding how to address this finding and whether or not dissolution of the Foundation would be ethically preferable to its continued operation. Arguments in favor of continuing the existence of the Foundation primarily concerned the consequences of its eradication, both in terms of possible political instability and strengthening of opposing Groups of Interest. Arguments against this noted the ethical consequences entailed by facilitating further existence of the anomalous, largely in terms of civilian casualties and the dubious morality of containing the anomalous in the first place given their existence is a direct consequence of the Foundation's establishment.

> The Foundation was created with a simple goal -- ensure the safety of man from the anomalous. We have taken many actions some would consider to be unethical or of questionable moral permissibility in our time. It has been an unspoken understanding among the members of this Council that such actions were done not because we had a personal interest in them, but because the failure to enact them would prove unacceptably consequential for the men and women we are sworn to protect. This has been the burden of the Foundation since its inception. Yet, as I write this dissenting opinion after the conclusion of today's vote, I find myself questioning whether or not I can justify remaining a part of the organization I help command. 
> 
> Make no mistake -- the Foundation has created the anomalous. Our existence spawned forth countless creatures of the dark, unexplained phenomena, and bizarre, grotesque blights on the face of the Earth. Not all of these are dangerous, but many are, and the number of innocent people who have been slain at the hands of the unexplained and the paranormal defies countability. Yet we have always done what we could to prevent this. But now, I can only explain the failure of this motion to pass as being one born of a personal stake in a deeply, necessarily impersonal matter. The Overseers who voted against this do so because of their personal interests. The destruction of the Foundation would, by necessity, mean the destruction of the Council. With the Council gone, what are we? A handful of researchers with little more than a curiosity in the unexplained, stripped of our gifts and our special privileges because those gifts are no longer required.
> 
> It is hubris. It is greed. And it is sickening.
> 
> I have already been informed that the Council intends to render this matter classified, and intends to institute a mission statement that makes no mention of what has been discussed today.  To everyone else in the Foundation, the anomalous is something we are at war with. Something that existed long before us and will continue to exist after we are long gone. But I will die before I relinquish the truth from my grasp. To continue serving this institution -- this great evil -- is nothing less than a moral calamity. I urge everyone on the Council to deeply and fundamentally reconsider their actions.

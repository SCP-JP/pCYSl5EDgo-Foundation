++++ **__Memorandum__**
[[/=]]
//To all Site-32 staff, please remember that SCP-6892 should be placed in the open, preferably somewhere secluded, as day to day operations are not impeded.//

//For all Site-32 staff who may not have been informed, SCP-6892 is a silver urn with a heart design embossed on the front.//

//Please minimize all interactions with SCP-6892 to avoid damage or the spilling of its contents. The mess is not cleanable.//

//As of this memo, SCP-6892 is currently located in Research Room 3 of B-Wing. Do not remove SCP-6892, as I still have important work to finish.//

//If staff report sightings of an individual displaying paranormal properties, such as intangibility or levitation, do not be alarmed. These are simply the properties of SCP-6892-1.//

//To O'Hara and Director Roberts, I would like to extend a thank you for your constant attendance and prayers on the anniversary of my death; it means more than I could ever express.// 

- Snr. Researcher, Lucy Fergurson. **â€ **

**Item #:** SCP-6317

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** To the extent of the Foundation's efforts, means of preventing SCP-6317 or tracing the source of the anomaly are unable to be attained. Phone records between the relevant SCP-6317-1 instance and the caller are to be logged by Foundation staff and terminated from public records. All further means of handling incidents in regards to SCP-6317 are to be dealt with per standard procedure.

**Description:** SCP-6317 is the designation given to the phone number ██ (███) ███-████ that will call individuals on a seemingly random basis. Managing to call SCP-6317 directly will lead to a non-anomalous four-member family home phone. 

Individuals called by SCP-6317 will be interrogated by an unknown individual vocally male. Call records in regards to SCP-6317 suggest 24% of called individuals engaged with the anomaly, with the remaining 76% of called individuals either refusing the caller or not answering the call. 

Those who engaged with the caller will be designated SCP-6317-1 and will tend to comply for the duration of the call, which typically spans approximately nine minutes in length. Though untested, it is effectively confirmed a memetic effect is induced after an individual engages with the caller.

For the duration of the initial call, the caller will ask multiple questions in regards to one or two of the individual's mother or singular parental figure. Calls from SCP-6317 appear to specifically target a mother figure. If the SCP-6317-1 instance does not have a maternal figure, it will target the individual's father. This factor does not appear affected if the parental figure is adoptive. The call will conclude with the caller thanking the SCP-6317-1 instance for their participation. 

On the proceeding March 1^^st^^, the SCP-6317-1 instance will receive another call from SCP-6317. If the caller refuses to answer the call, the figures of interest discussed in the initial call will be terminated by natural means in the following hours. If the caller answers, a 31-day process will initiate. Despite the contents of this process, the SCP-6317-1 instance will continue to engage for the entirety of the month.

At an undetermined but consistent time, once a day for the entirety of the month, the SCP-6317-1 instance will receive a call from SCP-6317. These calls will grow grimmer and more verbally abusive as the process progresses. During this process, the subject will show symptoms including traits of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Anti-Social Personality Disorder. By the 15^^th^^ day of this process, the SCP-6317-1 instance will develop a detrimental fear and hatred towards the caller. However, the memetic effect(s) induced by SCP-6317 will develop neurological oddities pertaining to unpredicted homicidal tendencies, turbulent thinking, and suicidal invasive thoughts throughout the month. 

The process will conclude on the 31st day of the process with the SCP-6317-1 instance fatally injuring their family figure(s) of interest as a result of manipulation curtesy of the caller, in which the instance will stop receiving calls from SCP-6317. 

**Addendum 1:** VHS audio tape recovered from the household of late Senior Researcher Henderson.
[[collapsible show="+ LEVEL-4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED" hide="- Hide addendum"]]
//The transcript has been translated from French, Henderson's born language.//

[[div class="blockquote"]]

##grey|//Henderson can be heard crying before beginning to rant, a car alarm sirens in the background.//##

**Henderson:** "To whoever is hearing this, I am so so sorry. Please, please, whoever finds my body, cremate it as soon as possible. I can't let my wife and daughter see me like this. I want them to remember me as I was. Please, for the love of God, despite what I did."

##grey|//Henderson pauses, pounding the floor with his fist before the sound of a gun sling cocking can be heard. Henderson's weeping grows.//##

**Henderson:** "Uhm, so- I'm going to shoot myself- in the head. It'll be quick, I hope. But- uhm- before that, I feel I need to explain myself."

##grey|//Henderson can be heard blowing his nose into a tissue.//##

**Henderson:** "So a few months back I got- I got this call. It seemed like any ordinary call, so I answered and- and- and it was some man. I- heh- named him Rye Rye. I don't know why. And he- he asked about my mom and I- I just told him! I told him everything for some reason! He warned something could happen to my mom and I was fucking terrified but- but then everything was fine when I went to her house."

##grey|//Henderson pauses.//##

**Henderson:** "But then- then- a few months later- a month ago- I received a call from Rye Rye again. This time it was- different. It was- hostile. Hostile like a shark. Hostile like a bee circling you. Hostile in a passive sense. Again, it was about my mother, but this time she was a- kind of- backseat to its true intentions."

##grey|//Henderson pauses.//##

**Henderson:** "It's true intentions- targeting me. It wanted me. Wanted my- my- something. But I know it had to do with me! But anyway- over the course of the month, I- I was called every day. Every single fucking day! In the early morning, every day, Rye Rye called me. He became my torturer and only friend, as he tricked me- or maybe I tricked myself- into cutting off from everyone else. Again- again! I'm so sorry, Danielle and- and- Sophia, my wife, and daughter. I really- really, really loved you two, please. I just couldn't let you see me like this. I was- was- so isolated and alone. Rye Rye- he became- abusive. He threatened me, my- my mother, my wife, my daughter, and- and everyone I loved. I can remember a- a single thing he said. Clear as fucking day. He said- he- he said something- something like: 'Your baby girl will attain a nasty, even fatal, disease at her daycare unless you comply.' He was maniacal at times, not in a direct sense- in a passive-aggressive sense. But this was different. It- it horrified me."

##grey|//Henderson snickered briefly, before laughing maniacally.//##

**Henderson:** "I- I imagine Rye Rye, that bitch, in a black suit- and a fedora- no- no!- no wait, a bowler hat, and cane! He has a cigar in his- his mouth, on the- the- left- no, right side. And he sits in a nineties leather chair- y'know the type fucking detectives use- I mean- used."

##grey|//Henderson returns to crying, letting out a loud weep.//##

**Henderson:** "But then- on the- the twenty-eighth day- it all changed. He made a switch in tone, he became truly condemning and he began discussing- something grave. He began discussing my mother, again, and how I should- how I should- should-"

##grey|//Henderson pauses for a minute.//##

**Henderson:** "He began discussing- like- how I should- kind of- kill her. How I should- should save her- from him. I think. I can't remember, it was a blur. But- but today, he outright demanded it. I don't know why! I don't know why! I don't know why! I don't know why, but I took to doing it!"

##grey|//Henderson pounded the floor with his fist again.//##

**Henderson:** "I agreed to fucking do it! And- and- I did it. I drove over to her house, I almost crashed, and I broke in. It was midnight, and I used the key she always hid in a stupid hanging coconut decoration to get in. I had a knife- a big, sharp one- in my pocket and I broke into her room, throwing the door open. I- I- I stabbed her. I tried to make it quick, I swear, I swear! I tried so damn hard to make it quick! I kept stabbing for minutes before I passed out on the floor. I- I woke up to the rotting smell. It smelt awful, horrible, wretched. I grabbed the knife and drove home. I felt- I felt better- the number on my phone was gone. It was fucking gone! As if it had never existed! But I know it did, I know it fucking did! Because my mom is dead! I killed her!"

##grey|//Henderson pauses.//##

**Henderson:** "I drove home. And- and- I realized I can't live with this. I can't live with killing my fucking mother! I still have- have the knife. I've been staring at it for an hour as I thought of how to go about it."

##grey|//The sound of a metal slate, presumably the knife, hitting the floor can be heard.//##

**Henderson:** "Oh fuck this. God damnit. I'm so sorry."

##grey|//The audio ends abruptly with a loud static.//##

[[/div]]

//Henderson would be discovered to have died from a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound. Henderson's death would be framed as the result of suicide, proven by falsified medical records. The audio tape would be stored in Foundation investigational archives.//

**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** The abuse of SCP-6416 by Foundation personnel for trans-temporal communication is prohibited under Articles II-IV of the [*/scp-5618 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement]. Intentional offenders threaten the individuality of distinct timelines, and are to be pursued to the extent of [*/welcome-to-delta-t RCT-Δt] Iteration Prime's abilities.

**##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##**[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]This document is, and should continue to be, written in adherence to the **##green|SECURITY MEASURES##** described within **##green|FILE:## ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##**. Please ensure you are familiar with such measures before proceeding.[[/span]] are to be isolated from unsupervised use where possible. Should retrieval of any instance become feasible, it is to be rendered dormant via chronological dissociation and extended storage in the Oblique Possibility Wing. Research is permitted in sole assistance to the containment of SCP-6416 and similarly threatening phenomena.

Once per respective annum, all relevant iterations of the individual most commonly known as '[*/scp-5242 Placeholder McDoctorate]' must submit all puzzle cubes in their collection to their respective RCT-Δt Iteration for inspection. Known aliases include:

* Mr. Place "The Doc" Holder;
* [*/scp-5492 Technician John Doe];
* Dr. Abstract "Abbie" M'Doctorat;
* [*http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/scp-2844-jp プレースホルダー];
* Rsr. Place M. DeKnow-It-All;
* Person The Scientist;
* Sir Mac Doctorium, Holder of Places;
* Blankface McBoxhead;
* Dir. Esoterica Eccentric;
* [*/admonition-hub "PHMD"];
* O5-6 (Cycle Four);

This individual must --never-- be promoted to Overseer (or analogous) status.

**UPDATE:** All documentation regarding SCP-6416, **##blue|SCP-INTEGER##**, and the aforementioned individual are to be distributed to all possible Coalitional Iterations of RCT-Δt for containment study.
----
**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-6416 is a multiversal metaprobabilistic phenomenon which synchronizes the states of a countably infinite set of **##green|FOURTH-ORDER PUZZLE OBJECTS##**. SCP-6416 manifests across a range of universes (hereafter **Timeplane-6416**) in which the following conditions are met:

* an individual (hereafter PoI-5242) constituting a 99.99998% or greater DNA match to Dr. Abstract M'Doctorat is employed by their respective Foundation-like entity;
* PoI-5242 undergoes [*/scp-5242 severe identity abstraction] via brief characteristic interchange with a necessarily unspecified semiontological entity;
* said abstraction affects a **##green|FOURTH-ORDER PUZZLE OBJECT##** (hereafter **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##**) within PoI-5242's possession;
* PoI-5242 is eventually promoted to Overseer status (invariably O5-6).

In any timeline which meets the above criteria, all instances of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** are actually //the same instance//, as they have been abstracted to the same fundamental state by **##blue|SCP-INTEGER##**. Collapsing the state of any instance simultaneously collapses every other instance to the same state, causing the restructuring of each of their respective timelines to justify such. To grossly oversimplify: **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** is synchronized across **TP-6416**, and the reconfiguration of any instance results in alterations to the histories of all other instances such that they are identical. It is theorized that this trans-temporal synchronization occurs at the [*/placeholder narrative level], and, thus, supersedes temporal influence.

Iterations of PoI-5242 tend to carry **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** on their person with increasing frequency over the duration of their tenure. No single instance can cease existing without all other instances doing the same; the unlikelihood of such an outcome practically ensures the continued existence of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** throughout **TP-6416**. Furthermore, SCP-6416's chronological restructurings adhere to the Path-of-Least-Resistance property, enacting the least drastic possible alterations to justify the state of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##**. In keeping it on their person, PoI-5242 strengthens their causal relationship to the **##green|PUZZLE##**, thereby becoming the most probable mechanism for its reconfiguration which, in turn, increases the likelihood of their own continued existence. It is theorized that relevant iterations of PoI-5242 are aware of these properties and abuse them for parachronological self-preservation.

In **TP-6416**, PoI-5242 is eventually promoted to Overseer status; it is unclear whether said promotion is causally dependent on their use of SCP-6416. Whether pre- or post-promotion, PoI-5242  eventually develops a communications matrix which reads and decodes the state of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** into an unknown form of instruction, likely memetic in nature. The observation of these instructions by PoI-5242 results in their respective Foundation's development of paratechnologies which then allow their isolation from RCT-Δt's influence via interdimensional data shielding. Approximately 44% of timelines within **TP-6416** have become isolated in this fashion.

It is assumed that PoI-5242, in serving as O5-6 and maintaining externally-observable trans-temporal autosynchronization, is generally aware of its violations of the 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement and promotes universal isolation in order to avoid RCT-Δt's containment attempts. The results of further instruction, or any other causal progression, of any such timeline is indeterminate. --Any intelligently-designed data communicated by **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** is likely generated by another instance of PoI-5242 in a timeline which has been rendered unobservable, although such a hypothesis is non-falsifiable.--

During the 2024 inspection of PoI-5242 Iteration-Prime's puzzle cubes, it was discovered that one **##green|ELEMENT##** had become an instance of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** in spite of RCT-Δt Iteration Prime's efforts to prevent the conditions of its manifestation. Said instance was confiscated without explanation, and remains under investigation within the Oblique Possibility Wing[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]RCT-Δt's Oblique Possibility Wing is chronologically synchronized with all other instances of itself, thereby heavily restricting the range of likely outcomes of any given structure contained within it.

+++ INITIAL PROPOSAL
[[/=]]
----
**CONTEXT:** SCP-6416 is a set of **##green|ABSTRACTED PUZZLE OBJECTS##** whose states are synchronized across the infinite subset of timelines in which they are (respectively) owned by an individual of virtual genetic identicality to Dr. Abstract M'Doctorat (aka. PoI-5242). Iterations of this individual use SCP-6416 as a parachronological immortality token and communications mechanism, abusing its properties to gain maximum authority within the Foundation (or similar entity) and isolate their respective timeline from any external to **TP-6416**. It is believed that these iterations are cooperating to intentionally endanger the chronological metastability of their respective causal branches.

**PROPOSAL:** Enlist Dr. M'Doctorat in the creation of a communications analysis matrix similar to those observed thoughout **TP-6416**, as they are most likely to succeed in replicating their own variants' designs. Utilize said matrix in conjunction with [*/scp-3955 CAOCIT][[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Cyclical Analysis Over Countably-Infinite Time[[/span]] systems to generate and decode the sum of communications sent via SCP-6416 over the phenomenon's duration. Determine whether more drastic measures should be taken to contain SCP-6416.

**METHODOLOGY:** Unclear; dependent on subject. Resource request pending authorization of sharing relevant data with Dr. M'Doctorat.

**SPEAKING:** Dr. Abstract M'Doctorat, [*/scp-5616 Dir. Elliot Reynders].

**FOREWORD:** Dr. M'Doctorat was briefed on the nature of SCP-6416 and questioned regarding the feasibility of Project 6416/Prime.
----
= **<BEGIN LOG>**

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** //Je ne pense pas que tu comprends.//

**Dir. Reynders:** Which part am I not understanding?

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** The sheer number of combinations which can be expressed by a //Rubik's Cube!// Let alone a four-by-four -- the task you demand is of universal proportion. I'm a quantum physicist, not a, a... //cryptographer//.

**Dir. Reynders:** All the other //you//s did it; statistically speaking, it's certain that you're capable of this. Plus, your fields of study heavily diverge across the span of your career.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** //Fantastique!// <//getting up from chair//> Talk to me again in twenty years when I've solved cancer, or 'pataphysics, or --

**Dir. Reynders:** Abbie, sit down.

= <//Dr. M'Doctorat complies.//>

**Dir. Reynders:** First of all, you're the only person in this universe who can do it, and that's not debatable; secondly, you'd be allowing the study of a potential multiversal threat.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** ... where's the 'thirdly'?

**Dir. Reynders:** Was I supposed to give a 'thirdly'?

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** Of course! Rule of threes, //et cetera//.

**Dir. Reynders:** <//sighs//> I //might// let you know what a bunch of power-hungry versions of yourself are using the multiversally-synchronized Rubik's Cube to talk about.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** //Such enthusiasm.// Yes, fine -- I could use a break from my quantum ectoentropy research. I assume I am at liberty to request the assistance of the Cryptography Division? Oh, and the AIAD! I'll need access to [*/scp-5241 my old analytical frameworks]...

**Dir. Reynders:** Draw up something //comprehensible//, and I can get it in front of the Council by the end of the week.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** All my reqisitions are //comprehensible//! It is no fault of mine if the concepts I manipulate are beyond others' reach.

**Dir. Reynders:** Be that as it may, I need to be able to pitch this.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** Right, right... //question?//

**Dir. Reynders:** Shoot.

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** Isn't it dangerous for me to have observed the info from the **##green|OBJECT##**? If said info is instructions that persuade me to become an Overseer and isolate the timeline, we are doomed, yes?

**Dir. Reynders:** This is the first RCT-Δt-controlled timeline in Timeplane-6416. It appears the anomaly is spreading outside its originating causal branches, and we believe, by 'getting out in front of it', we're preventing you -- and us -- from going down that path.

**SPEAKING:** Dir. Elliot Reynders, O5-9 (Oracle).

**FOREWORD:** Having just observed an apparently cognitohazardous communication decoded from SCP-6416 by the newly-functional Enigmaverse Engine, Dir. Reynders insisted on the impromptu hosting of the following debriefing. O5-9, the only internally-recognized individual possessing Oracle-Class cognitive resistance enhancements, happened to be present for an investigation of the Engine's functioning; they were thusly rushed from another area of the facility to the recording chamber where Dir. Reynders was located.

**O5-9:** So you //do// have a suggestion?

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** Duh. We send the **##green|CUBE##** to another Abbie. Or, we send it somewhere else within **TP-6416**, if we don't want to endanger another of the //literally infinite// timelines.

Up to the point of shielding, we can still communicate our findings to other RCT Iterations, potentially enabling them to "solve it for everyone else later".

**Dr. M'Doctorat:** Well, yes, but that's not... I'm not... That's not me. I am no Overseer, nor an evil mastermind, and I will not be made a fool.

**O5-9:** If your only alternative is kicking the can down the road, then the decision is made.

= **ADDENDUM 6416/IV:** Incident Report

During operational year 4 of Project 6416/Prime, significant improvement was consistently noted by Dr. M'Doctorat's parapsychologists and therapists in stark contrast to the preceding period of extended depression. In consultation with Project Advisor O5-9, it was determined by the Council that Dr. M'Doctorat be scheduled for promotion to Overseer status within one week, as she had already undergone much of the necessary training for the O5-6 (Operator) position. This drew attention away from Dr. M'Doctorat's off-Site activity during this time. Over the following week, an assortment of mechanical components and lab equipment were gradually brought off-Site by M'Doctorat, with several items corresponding to those used in the construction of the Enigmaverse Engine.

 On 2028/04/16, Dr. M'Doctorat was found deceased within her residence due to cessation of brain function, later revealed to be memetically-induced. Adjacent to her body was a second iteration of the Engine equipped with two-way capability, forcing **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** through a series of partially-observed states to collapse a desired configuration. All previous communications had been erased from memory; it remains unclear whether the cognitohazard responsible for M'Doctorat's death was inflicted by SCP-6416 or herself, whether intentional or otherwise.

A final communication was generated prior to the retrieval of M'Doctorat's body:

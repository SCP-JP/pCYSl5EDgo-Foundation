**Surrealistic Contrapment Policies:** SCP-6454 is to be contained within the north-left wing of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6445/ Site-⌘]'s anart[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]A word which here means "anomalous art," "anxious arthropod," or "ah! an artist!"[[/span]] gallery, right between the stuffed heads of those dogs that play poker and the box where we keep Monet's //real// paintings.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]I'm not allowed to describe them here, but they're quite saucy, I'll have you know.[[/span]] When interpreting or critiquing SCP-6454, viewers are not to use the following terms:

* Color
* Shape
* Texture
* Emotion
* Depth
* Paint

Personnel are not to feed SCP-6454 if it requests food in a manner that could be considered **impolite**-- like screaming, telekinetically yanking some poor sod's limbs off, or devouring the entire facility again.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]It can never keep us down, mind. Like a children's toy from any fast food restaurant, Site-⌘ is a choking hazard.[[/span]] If SCP-6454 requests food //politely//[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]As it is a painting and cannot speak, a "polite request" is composed of pleasing weather patterns and freeform jazz.[[/span]] it is to be fed immediately. Watching SCP-6454 eat isn't disallowed, but let's just say the roving glass storms aren't the only reason why we have so many emergency eye-wash stations in our art gallery.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Trust me when I say you're not missing out. There is a downright //distressing// amount of slime involved in the process.[[/span]]

SCP-6454 can be fed pretty much anything on hand, with the following exceptions:
* Milk products[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Lactose intolerance.[[/span]]
* Anything in sets of prime numbers
* Mirrors
* Trickle-down economics
* Feet[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Lack-toes intolerance.[[/span]]
* Windows
* The flayed corpse of God
* The Spanglish Inquisition
* Butterflies
* Lists[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]I threw some lists into this document to prevent SCP-6454 from chowing down on it. You're welcome.[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-6454 is a 1.5 meter by 1 meter canvas painting[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]See attached image to the right.[[/span]] that was discovered on 07/28/2017 in the center of a ~59.65 km^^2^^ expanse that previously held the landscape of Paris, Texas. It is not currently known how SCP-6454 was created, who/what created it, or how arrived in Paris.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Investigators claim that it's probably not important anyway and that they'd like to see //you// try, if you're so smart.[[/span]] 

All that is currently known about this event is that when SCP-6454 ate Paris, it only left behind 9-year-old Mary Ashling's handmade lemonade stand.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]See attached image above.[[/span]] Ashling is currently in Foundation custody, pending interrogation.

**Addendum 6454+1: MTF Logs**

Shortly after Paris, Texas' disappearance was made known to the Foundation, Mobile Task Force ⌘-0.25 ("Doomed Patrol") was dispatched to retrieve SCP-6454 and ascertain the whereabouts of Paris' inhabitants.

**South:** I-- yes. What?

**Vincent:** Heads up, everyone. Our bodycams just switched on. I set them to only record when interesting things are happening, so keep your third eyes peeled. Copy?

**South:** Copy.

**Key:** --Copy.--

**Escher:** Copied!

//[The group nears the lemonade stand. SCP-6454 is leaned up against it in plain sight.]//

**Key:** --This is the anomaly, yes?--

**South:** Looks a bit shit.

**Vincent:** What's your read on this, Escher?

//[Escher scrapes a bit of paint off of SCP-6454 with her fingernail and pops it into her mouth. She hums thoughtfully.]//

**Escher:** //[Thoughtful.]// Hmmmmm.

**Escher:** It's alive, but dormant right now after a big meal. Hasn't yet gotten to digesting, either, which is good for the Tex... 

**Escher:** Texans? Texites? //[Pause.]// Texicans!

**Vincent:** Is there a way we could enter the painting without being eaten?

**Escher:** 'Course. It's like this: art is a mirror, yeah? Reflects the dark heart of man or whatever. The question is: is your reflection in there...

**Escher:** Great work, me.

**Key:** --I feel like I'm gonna yarf.--

**South:** ...Can you even do that?

**Key:** --You don't want to find out.--

**Escher:** I do.

**Vincent:** //Focus.// We need to find the location that the anomaly began eating from.

**Key:** --Why?--

**Vincent:** Because the end is always found at the beginning, where the end is. Or the middle, sometimes.

**Vincent:** Obviously.

**South:** I'll lead us there.

**Vincent:** Have you picked up a scent?

**South:** //[Hastily shoving the script to SCP-6454 into his back pocket.]// Sure, we'll call it that.

**Addendum 6454+2: Paris Recovery**

Shortly after Paris, Texas was removed from the painting, Class B and Class ⌘ amnestics were applied to the city via an old-timey biplane flying overhead with two open buckets.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Class B amnestics remove memories from people.

**Addendum 6454+3: Addendum 6454+4**

A standard size postage stamp has been discovered on the back of SCP-6454. The following text was written on it in large block capitals with mango-scented marker:

Greetings and saluditations, fellow reprobates!

@@ @@

I must say, I am rather disappointed with you! Here I thought this "Department of Surrealistics" shared our ideals-- when it turns out you're just like the rest of those fun-hating Foundation fuddy-duddies.

You really ought to loosen up. Life's a party, after all, and we're all invited! Live a little! Take a risk! Steal from your workplace! Feed a city full of thinking, feeling people to a malevolent painting!

We were going to invite you to our semi-annual barbecue & knitting tournament, you know. I had a roast pig stored in my cold oven[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]An appliance that people who are //wrong// call a "fridge."[[/span]] just for you![[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Oh, but I do enjoy these footnotes![[/span]]

There's no need to worry about hard or harmed feelings, however. We meant to send the painting to that //other// Paris, but //someone// who's about to lose their job (among many, //many// other things) got the aim wrong. If anything, //we// owe //you// for cleaning up our mistake! You can keep the painting-- consider it my gift to you.

Hugs and kisses,

Rataplan R. Handlinger, Vice President of the Shivering Brigade

+++ SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES
[[/=]]

SCP-6447 is contained in a standard exclusion zone based around the former Provisional Site-127. On the 15th of each calendar month, an equal mixture of essential oil of sage and butane must be dispersed throughout SCP-6447's chamber. After a 12-hour quarantine period, personnel may resume collection of Compound R-447 from SCP-6447.

The appeasement ritual necessary for R-447 secretion must be completed without error; SCP-6447 will be considered uncontained if the ritual is incomplete.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Please contact Thaumaturgical Practices Advisor Randy Leonard for details concerning this ritual process.[[/span]] Personnel involved in this ritual are required to wear tattered clothing with a collective cost less than 50 USD. No personnel are to enter its containment chamber or be within its vicinity during its active phase on the 15th of every month.

++++ UPDATE -- 1951/12/15
[[/=]]

The immediate consumption of R-447 substances has been deemed a safety-critical process for all Ex-Provisional Site-127 staff. Failure to comply with this process may result in obsessive and compulsive tendencies toward SCP-6447.

+++ DESCRIPTION
[[/=]]

SCP-6447 refers to an amalgam formed from the entire operating staff of the former Provisional Site-127, known to the public as the Dolores King Memorial Belltower.

[[include component:image-block
|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6447/dolores-king-memorial.png
|caption=Ex-Provisional Site-127. SCP-6447 is located inside the bell chamber.]]

The collective of SCP-6447 is instinctively identified as 328 human beings and constantly plays a selection from Vivaldi's //The Four Seasons//, corresponding with the season of the antipode of Bear Mountain, New York. SCP-6447 produces the sounds necessary to achieve this by use of numerous methods, including but not limited to:

* Vocalization.
* Several modified skull bones.
* Flatulence.
* A bell from the former Provisional Site-127 carillon.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]**DEFINITION -- carillon:** A set of bells, often in a bell tower, operated by means of a keyboard.[[/span]]

97% of Foundation clairvoyants believe the formation of SCP-6447, and its ritualistic and melodic nature, exist to appease an **##d1423d|Emergent Eschatological Entity##** (henceforth referred to as **##d1423d|EEE-6447##**) being awakened by humanity's collective transgressions. **##d1423d|EEE-6447##**'s nature and motives are currently indeterminate and attempts to establish contact are ongoing. In the event its activity or existence threatens humanity, Directive APSYCHOS is to be initiated.

Directive APSYCHOS, previously enacted for the purposes of extracting and studying R-447, has since been reformed into a multistage process consisting of ritualistic appeasement by living personnel within Ex-Provisional Site-127.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]The exact specifications of such a ritual are known only to Randy Leonard of Ex-Provisional Site-127, and must remain as such until the safety of outside Foundation personnel can be guaranteed.[[/span]] The success of SCP-6447 in achieving its goals is highly dependent on the amount of R-447 it retains throughout its melody.

Further investigation into R-447 has since revealed that the substance increases the metaphysical attractiveness of any person who consumes it. However, its consumers remain immunized against attraction to each other, and to SCP-6447.

Additionally, R-447 acts as a perfect and highly localized Akiva sink when consumed and exposed to frequencies from 330 Hz – 700 Hz. It then suppresses and destroys 99% of ambient and focused Akiva radiation. Despite the outward physical distress of SCP-6447, its capacity to secrete R-447 has rendered it highly attractive to persons possessing a Cognitive Resistance Value or CRV ≤ 50, and to those who have not consumed R-447. Once attracted, these persons will invariably join its chorus and provide additional harmonies -- hence, the development of the appeasement ritual to maximize R-447 collection with minimal loss of personnel.

In 1962, SCP-6447 began exerting significant meteorological influence over a variable diameter, altering temperature and precipitation in accordance with each concerto in //The Four Seasons//. Phenomena such as thunder, lightning, heat waves, and the aurora borealis occur in sync with the anomaly.

+++ HISTORY
[[/=]]

While the exact origin of SCP-6447 is unknown, the Foundation initially became aware of the anomaly shortly after losing contact with Provisional Site-127 in 1945. When the Site missed its monthly check-in, the Foundation dispatched an investigation team that discovered all Provisional Site-127 staff members had gone missing. Further investigation revealed SCP-6447 within the Site's tower.

After its discovery, a public disinformation campaign was put into place regarding SCP-6447. Witnesses at that time shared reports about "the renewal of nature"; one witness stripped their clothing and repeatedly mentioned "the return" while they burned it. Disinformation quickly became ineffective as the music continued. The dearth of context surrounding SCP-6447's properties impeded containment officers, created further subjects, and necessitated emergency aid from nearby Sites. After repeated procedure failure, the use of R-447's immunizing effect was considered as an alternative containment measure. The Ethics Committee initially rejected this.

Preliminary testing via the addition of Compound R-447 to the water supply of Akron, Ohio, resulted in Foundation clairvoyants reporting the delay of **##d1423d|EEE-6447##**'s awakening. Further testing with larger population centers was later approved.

The transition of Appalachian water sources into high-ppm R-447 mixtures (disguised as fluoride) gave regional clairvoyants the most lucid understanding of **##d1423d|EEE-6447##**'s existence to date, resulting in their current near-certainty. 20 million Americans trapped in consumer cycles gained a similar, subliminal awareness. Many began spending less on consumables and investing in residential fallout shelters.

Although initial trials indicated a reduction in SCP-6447's effects, extended manipulation of the anomaly's weather-modifying attributes was later determined to be environmentally damaging towards surrounding ecosystems. As such, additional investigation was approved, and Directive APSYCHOS was officially enacted.

+++ INCIDENT REPORT -- 2014/10/15
+++++ RITUAL FAILURE
[[/=]]

While performing the appeasement ritual, Agent Rossellini had allegedly worn an engagement ring which Rsr. Sophia McCormack, her fiancée, reported having an estimated value of 4,000 USD. It is believed this lapse in protocol was due to the heightened attraction and feelings of attachment from the effects of R-447.

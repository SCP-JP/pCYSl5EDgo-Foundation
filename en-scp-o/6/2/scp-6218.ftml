**##fff|Special Containment Procedures:##**

The Department of Discretion spread a disinformation campaign in 2002 which discouraged space exploration, interest in the cosmos, and faster than light travel. The media and many academic institutions were planted with the idea that the universe is expanding and that humanity is trapped within the Milky Way's local group. 

Provisional Site-6218 has been constructed on the surface of SCP-6218. It is currently operational and manned by 18 rotating D-Class personnel from Site-9, who warp in and out with Triple-T[[footnote]]TTT, or Thaumaturgical Teleportation Threads: A catch-all term for fibers, textiles, and tape inscribed with a spell that teleports an object it is wrapped around to one of any number of preset teleportation circles. It is activated when its companion thread is cut, usually with scissors.[[/footnote]] and maintain the site's machinery. Provisional Site-6218 is to be used for dangerous experiments involving pre-approved anomalies, a list of which is found in Addendum 2.6.2010.

No one, under any circumstance, can stay on its surface for longer than two hours.

**##fff|Description:##**

SCP-6218 refers to a spherical body outside of the observable universe[[footnote]]The observable universe is not the entire universe, only as far as the laws of physics allow light to travel before it can no longer reach Earth.[[/footnote]] that contains the full universe.[[footnote]]Not to be confused with the known universe, the full universe is everywhere within baseline reality that the Foundation can traverse via physical means.[[/footnote]] It is estimated to be 2,108 billion light-years in diameter. For reference, Earth's solar system is 0.3 light-years in diameter.

The surface consists of black dust, primarily carbon. Its atmosphere is lethal to most humans, consisting of a previously unknown compound designated Y-2108. Despite the size and apparent mass of the surface, it has a disproportionately low amount of gravitational pull. Its force is roughly 0.2g, slightly more than Earth's moon. 

**##fff|Discovery:##**

SCP-6218 was discovered by the crew of IV-38[[footnote]]Short for Intergalactic Vessel 38. All Foundation issue intergalactic vessels come equipped with Anomalous Object [[span style="filter:blur(4px);"]]Ex Altiora[[/span]]. This anomaly stops time around an object so long as it is not biological matter. This acts as instantaneous travel between points A and B, no matter how far apart those points are in space. This anomaly, along with complex AICs, was how the Foundation advanced so far ahead of the non-anomalous world.[[/footnote]] while flying outside of the observable universe investigating another anomaly. They noticed that there were fewer stars visible on the starboard side of the ship than on the port side. The gradation between the two hemispheres was photographed and recorded in figure 1. 

IV-38 traveled into the hemisphere without stars and noticed that light from some of the stars was reflecting off of a single surface, SCP-6218. Attempting to fly around SCP-6218 to gauge its size, they determined from its curvature that they were on the inside of a sphere. They touched down and took samples, resulting in our basic knowledge of its makeup. They left the expedition early because they expressed a feeling of fear while on the surface.

The discovery made by the brave crew of Intergalactic Vessel 38 is both fascinating and disconcerting. We're classifying it as a new SCP, number 6218. I'd bet that it's the biggest one ever. 

The entire universe is contained within a massive cave. For once, this anomaly is containing us.

At first, I felt a little disappointed by this discovery. Infinity just sounded more exciting to me. Then I realized something: if it has an end, then it's knowable. Someday, humanity will have charted the entire universe. 

I propose that we build a provisional site on SCP-6218. Because of its distance from Earth alone, it could prove an invaluable containment location for dangerous anomalies.

[[/div]]
------

Director Moriette, I would like to thank you again for appointing me to this position. It's an honor to be in charge of such an important scientific discovery. But something just happened recently, and I thought you would like to know.

We started construction this morning. One of our crew had a rather alarming encounter with his dead fiancé on the surface of SCP-6218 this afternoon. Before long, another was seen carrying an invisible child, and another claimed that his stalker had followed him to SCP-6218.

These things all turned out to be nothing more than mirages, but they affected everyone working there, on the first day of construction no less. They had only been up there for four hours. This is no cabin fever, I think the surface of SCP-6218 might be hallucinogenic in some way. I'll need an expert in cognitohazards and such to look into this for me. God knows I'm never stepping foot up there after this. 

In the meantime, I'll need more men. The cost for the psych evaluations has already put a sizable dent in our budget. The icing on the cake is that doctor Skye[[footnote]]Agent Ivy Skye, the Psychiatrist on Site-9.[[/footnote]] said they were unfit to work. 

There was one thing of note that came out of the evaluations, though. Every single one of their hallucinations told them to leave.

Please respond.

[[/div]]
------

Director Moriette, your two-hour solution for the hallucinations worked like a charm! We had some minor incidents here and there, but they've been ironed out. 

However, I'm afraid I have more bad news. There was a series of earthquakes, and it looks like they won't stop any time soon. We figured it would be a one-off incident, so we waited until we thought it stopped the first time, and around four days into construction it happened again.

Looking into it further, we found that these earthquakes occur regularly, every 8 to 10 days. They can last up to 30 hours, but that's not the interesting part. They're passing over the site like a wave, and the wave's origin is from a single direction, I'll call it the east. 

We tried building somewhere else, lightyears away from the original location. Wouldn't you know it, more earthquakes. We tried two more times. Same intensity, same interval, different point of origin. Tests showed that the areas were hallucinogenic as well. 

We've wasted a lot of the budget already. I think we'll need more funds and more men if you want us to continue. Not only that, the schematics we have now aren't going to cut it. I believe that while the risks of the project may cause psychological pain to some of the builders, this is important for the greater good. Whatever's causing these earthquakes is a force on the scale of all existence.

Please respond.

I'm fairly confident now that the schematics we're using will work. We should finish up construction sometime around 2010. With that date approaching, I began the first project looking into the cause of SCP-6218's earthquake. I rented a Foundation craft and we tried following one of the earthquakes as it passed the site. We couldn't. 

My instinct is to simply say it was too big, but that doesn't do it justice. When everything is rumbling, it looks like nothing is rumbling, if that makes sense. From that vantage point, I could tell that the secret lies underground. 

Once we're done building the site, the first big job will be digging a quarry into SCP-6218. I hope you agree. 

Please Respond.

Professor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.

Construction of Provisional Site-6218 was completed on February 14th, 2010. 

Director Moriette approved Kovelenko's proposal, and the mining operation commenced two weeks later.

Director Moriette, we chose a location for the quarry: a crater near the site. The obvious problem with digging into SCP-6218 is going to be the earthquakes. Every level that the miners dig out will be reinforced by metal plates and wooden beams to ensure that the progress lost from every quake is minimal. I will update you as I move forward.

[[/div]]
------

Director Moriette, an update. The makeup of SCP-6218's crust is a smattering of minerals typical to many terrestrial planets, and the layering is as expected. The plates are holding up well enough, but the workers are complaining about having to replace the beams every time. 

So some background, one of our workers had an accident. He cut open his spacesuit. After the initial panic, we discovered that humans can breathe in the atmosphere of SCP-6218, even though Y-2108 contains little to no oxygen. After that, the workers asked to work without their spacesuits. So I let them, thinking nothing of it. 

I think this is what lead to the murder last week. One of my workers, D-27134, hallucinated that D-35090 was a man by the name of Matthew Jeffreys. Jeffreys was D-27134's old roommate, whom D-27134 murdered two years prior, earning him his D-class status. 

It wasn't until today that we discovered that Y-2108 is behind these hallucinations. If we had known sooner, I wouldn't have had to lose any workers. But we didn't, so from now on the workers need to wear oxygen tanks. 

Thankfully, D-35090 was in the D-class because of a particularly heinous crime, so when you think about it he deserved to die. I'm hazy on the details, but if you tell that to those workers in a tizzy it should calm them down.

Director Moriette, we've dug 2.3 kilometers down now. Today, the miners struck a pit of black sludge. I've attached an image below. The substance appears to be made up of dead organic matter, like tar. We can't be sure that's what it is though. 

Whatever it is, we can't dig around it. I think we need someone from the Parabiology department to get up there and give it a look. Hopefully, we can refine it into a fuel source.

Hello Professor Kovalenkno, my name is Lee Eun-Choi. I'm an expert in the parabiology department. 

I had a look at the sludge your crew uncovered. It isn't just any sludge; it's a membrane. This kind of membrane is found in animal cells. The coating of oils on its surface indicates that it's a skin cell. The average skin cell, on a human, is 30 micrometers large. For reference, this is about as thick as a strand of hair.

This 'cell' is the size of a lake. If it behaves like cells on an average organism, then there are presumably trillions upon trillions of these cells, making up some kind of cosmic superbeing. 

This particular cell is dead, but that doesn't mean that the superbeing is as a whole. It's common for skin cells on the outermost layer of an animal to be dead. The workers on-site told me about the earthquakes and how they work. I believe that the earthquakes are caused by this being's pulse. The scale fits, and I don't see any other explanation for the ground rumbling like that. 

-Lee.

Director Moriette, there's a being underneath SCP-6218. I just received word from the scientist you sent up there.

Let's call this being SCP-6218-B, and change SCP-6218 to SCP-6218-A. If Eun-Choi is right about the earthquakes, then we need to take immediate action. The earthquakes indicate that the being extends all over the surface of SCP-6218-A. We need to understand what it is. 

The problem is, again, it's too big. We can't comprehend the being's shape from outside without considerable effort. This is going to sound crazy, but I propose we build a submarine and send a team of specialists in to dive into its cells.

Hi, this is Amber. I got the design ready. Here it is.[[footnote]]The design was attached to the email, contact your supervisor for a copy.[[/footnote]] I'm calling it "The Syringe" because of the bit that's sticking out. It pries the membrane open wide enough for us to come and go without any trouble. It'll also need to come attached to cranes so we can drop it into the pit in the quarry. 

Since SCP-6218-B is so big we probably won't provoke it. The only problem is that it'll need a crew because long-distance control isn't going to work. Something on SCP-6218-A is messing with the transmission. 

I put some memetic shields in the hull to protect against the hallucinations, but since you said it was the air, I don't think that will be a problem because it already had to be airtight. 

So yeah she should take the better part of a month to build. I think that's everything. Email me if you have questions. 

[[/div]]

Agent Ignatia's design was approved, and its construction was completed on August 22nd, 2018. 

Selected for the mission were four agents of MTF Xi-5: Roscoe Williard, Amber Ignatia, Ivy Skye, and Lee Eun-Choi. Each of them took part in a month-long training regimen preparing them for the mission. Their goal was to find a cell's nucleus[[footnote]]The nucleus is the core of the cell. It stores DNA, the instruction manual for how cells behave.[[/footnote]] and retrieve any amount of genetic information on SCP-6218-B.

The operation began on August 30th, 2018. The mission is cataloged below in the form of routine progress reports, taped by the mission's lead researcher, agent Lee Eun-Choi.

//Agent Ignatia, the mission's pilot, turned on the lights. The Syringe had no windows, so the crew looked out through a series of monitors connected to cameras on the vessel's exterior.//

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** What do you see, Amber?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** There's that thing right there, looks like scaffolding, but also a web. I think it's holding the cell up.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** It's rotting pretty bad. Looks like it could collapse any second.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** The cell //is// dead. I think this might have functioned as a cytoskeleton[[footnote]]The Cytoskeleton is the physical structure of a cell. The 'scaffolding' Ignatia pointed out is a series of intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments function as bones do in the skeleton of a vertebrate.[[/footnote]] when it was alive. Alright, what else?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Nothing really. Just the scaffolding. It's gonna make navigation tough, I'll have to slip between the openings, and it's swaying like a drunkard. This may take a while. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright, uh... it's not supposed to be this empty. Keep your eyes peeled. 

//The Syringe navigated through the cytoskeleton for a few hours. The cell was mostly hollow save for the cytoskeleton. Irrelevant audio omitted.//

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Whoa.

//The Syringe made it to the bottom of the cell. It was covered in a pile of corpses in various stages of decomposition.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What the hell are they doing here?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Beats me. They don't look like any fish I've ever seen.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** More importantly, what killed them?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Trust me, I'm working on that. It doesn't look like they were eaten, at least. Whatever it was, I was very wrong about this thing. We should be careful going forward.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright, so we have a fish out there. I still feel weird calling them fish, but it's floating. I can't tell if it's alive, but we haven't seen one floating yet. It looks like an invertebrate. There's this big sac thing coming out of its torso. It's full of some sort of liquid, and its mouth has that liquid flowing out of it. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##**  It has too many eyes.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Yeah. Lots of eyes. Alright, other updates... Why are the fish dead? My current hypothesis is that since we're still in the epidermis,[[footnote]]The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin, mostly comprised of dead skin cells and other bodily secretions.[[/footnote]] the death of these fish probably coincided with the apoptosis[[footnote]]Apoptosis refers to the natural, programmed death of a cell. When cells fail to die naturally, they take up too many resources, resulting in the ailment known as cancer.[[/footnote]] of the cell as a whole. Then, they must have sunk to the bottom over time because of gravity. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** They're part of the cell?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** I've been working on a hypothesis for a while now, um... many living things have symbiotic relationships with bacteria. See, mitochondria[[footnote]]Mitochondria are the organelles in animal cells essential to cellular respiration. This process generates ATP which the cells use for energy. Some refer to it as the 'powerhouse' of the cell.[[/footnote]] are believed to be older bacteria, that made their way into the bigger cells billions of years ago. Animal cells kept the mitochondria inside them as they reproduced, so now we can't live without them. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** So it's a mitochondria?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** No, I think I've been looking at it wrong, trying to compare it to something from Earth, something that's our size. These cells could be more complex lifeforms than we thought. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** So this little guy inside the cell could be made of cells himself?[[footnote]]This hypothesis was proven true, examining some of the samples brought back with the Syringe.[[/footnote]]

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Who knows, maybe the gods aren't so different after all.

//The creature darted away.//

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** There he goes.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Jesus!

//A large serpentine creature nearly collided with the Syringe. The sound of crashing metal was heard as agent Ignatia maneuvered the vessel away to avoid contact.//

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** What the fuck is that?!

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Is everyone alright?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I could barely see it coming.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Look at that thing! It's //huge!//

//The Syringe navigated away from the creature. The creature continued on its path through the cytoskeleton.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I don't think it saw us. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Did anyone get a good look at it?

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I couldn't see all of it, but it looked like an eel. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** At least it's gone. 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Could be back any second, though.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright, so Amber had a hallucination. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Come on, it was just a glitch in the monitor. All it was!

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I want to believe you, but it sure looked like a hallucination to me. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Whatever it was, we're all on oxygen tanks now. Can't risk it getting worse. We packed enough to last the whole mission, twice. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** So what did you see?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** That can't be relevant.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** If it was someone you know, or knew, then it's probably the air. [...] Want us to turn this off?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright, so we've come across what looks like an endoplasmic reticulum.[[footnote]]The endoplasmic reticulum is the organelle in cells that refines DNA into proteins. It's usually attached to the nucleus.[[/footnote]] It's secreting something, and the fish are feeding on it. It's the same substance we found in the mouth of that dead fish from before. 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Looks like a giant intestinal tract.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** I could see that, but I think that's just the tunnels wrapping around each other. If we follow them down, we should get to the nucleus.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Amber?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** On it.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright. Let's–

//The Syringe swerved as the same serpentine creature rammed into it.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** It followed us!

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Hold o–

//Agent Eun-Choi turned off the tape.//

//Camera 16 went dark, so the crew couldn't see the creature for most of the chase. After the expedition, the cause for this was discovered to be a corrosive substance on the side of the hull. The substance did not breach the hull, it simply left indents on its surface.//

//The creature was described as resembling an eel. However, it lacked a head. Where a head should have been, there was a structure resembling a human hand. The crew was uncertain if this was a limb of a larger creature or if it was all that the creature was.//

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright, so we made it into a new cell. Nobody's slept. Obviously, we didn't make it to the nucleus before that arm found us.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I don't know what it did to the hull, but it did something. Roscoe's looking at it right now. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** The plan is to wait it out down here for a bit. We need sleep. We're all starting to see things.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I'm gonna stay in the cockpit, in case we get attacked. Odds are, that thing is still after us. We're gonna try and find the way back up by going around it. 

//Papers shifted around.//

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Dammit. What the hell's the point of that thing? Lysosome? Cilia? Immune system? Does any of that even apply down here?

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I'm back. Everything's still airtight. No major–

//Agent Skye screamed on seeing agent Williard.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Hey! Get off him!

//Agent Skye rushed toward agent Williard, attempting to free him from a hallucinatory assailant. The remainder of the team went into a panic, and the tape was cut short a few seconds later. The issue resolved itself when Williard snapped Skye out of her hallucination.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Hey Lee, have you seen Roscoe? He's not in his room or the pit. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** That's weird, I thought he was in his room. But to answer your question, no. I haven't. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Okay. If you see him, tell him I'm sorry, would you?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** You know, I was supposed to be the expert on the hallucinations. But god... seeing one? I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. Some expert I am. 

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Don't worry about all that. You know, the month before the mission, I was reading everything we had on cells. What they looked like, what made them tick, but all that prep was completely worthless down here. It never turns out how you draw it up.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Nothing on our tail this time, either.

//The Syringe moved in on the external membrane of the nucleus. Its surface was made of a substance similar to coral, forming a shell around the nucleus.//

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Hey, we haven't been in the same room for a while, have we?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Guess not.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** You know what? You're lucky we're trapped down here. On the surface, I'd get your ass fired for what you did, you know that? You're a traitor and a threat.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Shut up! //Shut up!//

Beneath the audio for the following progress report, continuous whispering was heard. The whispering was not in any known language. These whispers have since been labeled a Grade 6 Cognitohazard, so this transcript was compiled automatically and corroborated by agents Skye and Ignatia.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** This fucking place...

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Maybe if I spoke to you sooner–

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Now isn't the time for that. Get into positions, we're going into the nucleus. 

//Agent Williard initiated the mechanism, and the Syringe drilled into the nucleus. The drill shattered the coral, exposing a large chamber inside the shell. The whispers became audible, though no source for them was visible yet.// 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** We're in.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** It's completely empty. There aren't even any struts supporting all this open space.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What was that?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** You see something, Ivy?

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I could have sworn I saw... never mind. I probably just hallucinated.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I think so. There's just nothing, as far as the eye can see.

//They traveled further into the nucleus. The whispers got progressively louder.//

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I'm sorry, does anyone else hear that? Sounds like a bunch of gibberish.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Yeah, I hear it too. Is someone whispering?

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I'm not crazy at least. It's coming from outside the hull, all around us. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** That can't be right. The headlights would be shining off something. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Maybe something's busted.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I checked every nook and cranny. The ship should be completely fine. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Are those...?

//The Syringe's headlights landed on a group of humanoid figures clinging together. They were buoyantly suspended in the cytosol, nude. Their mouths were in a perpetual state of motion, in sync with the whispers.//

//Each agent's count of these humanoids varies, but all of them reported 30-70 visible. They formed a tight, spherical mass. Despite the constant motion of the humanoids, the mass remained fixed in its location.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Oh my god, those are people!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** They can’t be, can they? There’s no way they can breathe out there. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What are they saying? I can’t make it out.  

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Look at those eyes. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. We should get away from–

//The humanoids outside The Syringe simultaneously stop whispering and turn to face the crew, specifically agent Eun-Choi. This is believed to be when SCP-6218-Autumn materialized within The Syringe.[[footnote]]SCP-6218-Autumn refers to a manifestation of one of agent Eun-Choi’s hallucinations. It took the form of one Jackson Autumn, Eun-Choi’s former neighbor.[[/footnote]] The crew froze in fear.//

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** W-what the hell?

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Fuck! Who the hell are you? Am I hallucinating?!

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Shit! I see him too! That makes no sense though, is this a mass hallucination?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Wait, Jackson?

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Fun's over, time to leave.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** What the- Oh my god!

//The humanoids swam in the cytosol toward the Syringe. They placed their hands on the hull and began whispering again. These whispers are now known to directly manipulate SCP-6218-Autumn, but in the moment, the agents panicked.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What do we do?!

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** They've got us surrounded! 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** What about this guy?!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Forget him, let's just get out of here!

//Eun-Choi switched off the tape as the humanoids began scratching at the hull. After that, agent Ignatia rammed the Syringe against them. They did not resist, letting go as the Syringe moved.

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Just like I remember. 

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Lee, how did you know Jackson?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** I told you, it was a long time ago. I left him, and that life, behind. 

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Funny way to put it.[[footnote]]This is about incident 9.5C.1984. In short, it was the supernatural disappearance of Jackson Autumn from the Prince's Estate Apartment complex. Of the many witnesses, all but agent Eun-Choi chose to be amnesticized. Eun-Choi instead opted to join the Foundation as a researcher. Currently, this incident is unexplained. SCP-6218-Autumn's knowledge of it is also a mystery.[[/footnote]]

After everything we've done for you, why can't you just be happy with what you have?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** We have to know what's out there. It's our job. 

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Like hell it is! What's curiosity gotten you, Lee? Huh? A life chasing ghosts? Goddammit, you were happier when you didn't know! You were happier without purpose! Then you just had to get all nosy, and it cost Jackson his life!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** You don't know that.

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** I know everything about your life!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Shut up, Jackson!

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Jackson is //gone.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Lee, what's he talking about?

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Fine, if you're so certain, tell me what happened to Jackson. 

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** There are things that your kind will never comprehend!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** So you //do// know! What happened in 1984!?

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** I just told you we don't know a damn thing!

**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** No! I know that look! Jackson! Look at me! //Look at me!//

//Agent Eun-Choi rushed at SCP-6218-Autumn. His fellow agents attempted to intervene, but before any contact was made the Syringe lurched, knocking the crew to the floor. SCP-6218-Autumn laughed.//

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What was that?!

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Did you do this?!

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** It's here! At last!

//The Syringe lurched again, and agents Williard and Skye made for the cockpit. Eun-Choi stayed behind. Skye grabbed the tape recorder on her way out, so SCP-6218-Autumn's cries grew quieter as she moved away from it.//

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** [indecipherable] –The blood! The blood!

//The crew met up with agent Ignatia in the cockpit, as SCP-6218-B's pulse overtook the Syringe.//

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Amber! What's– [indecipherable]

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** The damn current– [indecipherable] –don't know how much– [indecipherable] –Mary, full of grace– [indecipherable]

//The audio for the remainder of this tape is heavily distorted because the tape recorder was jostled by the pulse's current. The remainder of the mission was recounted by the crew in the debriefing.//

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I think the hardest part about the pulse reaching us was that we were so close to the surface. I'd just caught the first hint of daylight when the current started to hit us. Cytosol doesn't work like water, you know, it's more like molasses. But the current was as strong as any ocean shift.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Still can't get over the dead fish. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Right, right. The current was taking those dead fish from the bottom of the cell and flinging them at the hull. Next thing I knew, the current was pulling us along with them. It made us slam into that scaffolding, I think it was called a cytoskeleton. 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Yeah, the whole cell was caving in around us. 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Not that you could tell, it was dark as always. I had no time to react to the rubble. It's a wonder the whole thing is still airtight after all that. That never really made sense to me, because we shouldn't have made it out of there. I shouldn't have even been able to pilot the Syringe against that fucking current. 

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Hm. That explains the state of the ship. Now, the monster that was chasing you. Tell us what you know about that.

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I think that guy[[footnote]]SCP-6218-Autumn.[[/footnote]] called it the blood, because that's what it was. Blood. I didn't get the best look at it, to be honest. I was just focused on getting us out of there as fast as possible. Whatever it was, it called out to me. I had to fight the urge to turn back because I knew if I did we'd all get swallowed up by it. 

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I think it was trying to say it was sorry. For what, I don't know. I couldn't think straight, you know how it is in the field.

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I think it was more than that. I can't remember what it looked like at all. Every time I try my mind just wants to turn somewhere else. I start feeling cold for some reason. It must have done something to our heads.

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** And where do you think it went?

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I don't- hang on, why //did// it stop chasing us? 

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I was sure it had us.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** It had us, you can still see the bite marks on the hull. 

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Bite marks? I didn't see any of those. I checked thoroughly. Could you be thinking of something else?

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** No. It got us. Most of it was a blur, but I know that sound. That was teeth on metal.

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** I don’t know what to tell you. The ship was ruined, but there was nothing like that. Do you think it’s connected to what happened to Lee? 

//Xi-5 didn't respond.//

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** I said, do you–

**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** No, I heard you. It's just... Who's Lee? Was he with Eta-5?[[footnote]]MTF Eta-5 (Jäeger Bombers) is a task force specialized in combat against large-scale anomalies. They were present when the Syringe surfaced as a safety measure, though there was no sign of the monster Xi-5 had reported.[[/footnote]]

**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Lee Eun-Choi. The biologist we sent with you. The one who died.

**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** No, there were only three of us. Four if you count Jackson.

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** What?

**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I don't know anyone named Lee. Not at the Foundation, at least.

**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Hold on, I need to review the–

//Professor Kovalenko turned off the tape.//

//End Log.//

Through further questioning, it became apparent that Xi-5's memories of agent Lee Eun-Choi, as well as the collective memories of anyone who knew him, had been erased. None of them had been amnesticized. The only evidence that Eun-Choi existed is the physical documentation of his work (tapes, emails, notes).

The O5 council met on September 11th to discuss what was to be done about SCP-6218-B. Instead of continuing research into SCP-6218, a plan was made which complied more closely with SCP-6218-B's demands. Provisional Site-6218 was still to be maintained, but knowledge of SCP-6218-B was restricted to clearance level 4.

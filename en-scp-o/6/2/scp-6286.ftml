05-1 sighs and rubs the bridge of his nose. He can feel another headache building behind his eyes like a bank of storm clouds. It’s funny - as the leader of the Foundation, and therefore one of the most powerful people in the world - he’s still stuck behind a pile of paperwork like any ordinary desk jockey. 
But, there was a silver lining; unlike the vast majority of the mountain of reports the Foundation generates on a daily basis, not one word of these reports has been redacted. Nothing gets redacted from the head of the Overseer Council. 
He pulls the top file off of the pile and reads the words that have been stamped across the cover:
SCP-6286
The Firebird
    “Hmmm.” he murmurs to himself as he takes another sip of coffee. Interesting nickname. It’s always fun to see what name the researchers will bestow on the anomalies they’re studying, so they don’t just have to keep repeating the numbers over and over and over again.
    He opens the file and begins to read.

    //SCP-6286 is a seemingly-normal human girl who answers to the name of Marie Sanchez, with the ability to conjure fire out of thin air.//
    05-1 raises an eyebrow. Pyrokinesis? That anomaly in particular is very rare; as far as he knows, the only records in the Foundation archives of anything even remotely similar are nothing but third-hand reports and baseless rumors.

//She was born on November 15th, 2010, to Matais and Carmen Sanchez in Mexico City, Mexico.// 

    There’s a small picture that’s been included with the file. It’s a school photo, probably taken the past September, when Marie entered 7th grade. 05-1 picks up the photo for a better look. Marie Sanchez’s large dark eyes stare back at him, her mouth twisted into a slightly uncomfortable smile, like she’s embarrassed about being the center of attention, even though it’s just a school photo. Her charcoal-colored hair hadn’t been tied back, leaving it free to frame her face with its slight waves, and for a lock of it to fall across one of her eyes.
    She looks just like an ordinary kid, the kind who goes to school weekday mornings and does homework weekday evenings and hangs out with her friends on the weekends. 05-1 reads on.

    //On March 8th, 2022, at approximately 4:30 pm, 6286 was reportedly playing in her school’s playground after school when there was an incident with another student. According to a witness statement given by the teacher supervising the playground, the other student attempted to take the basketball 6286 and her friends were playing with. When 6286 tried to stop him, he shoved her, making her lose her balance and fall. Angered, 6286 got up and ran after him, attempting to get the ball back. When he refused to hand it over, she was somehow able to conjure fire out of thin air, causing minor burns on the other student’s arms and hands and partially melting the basketball.//

    05-1 sighs; it’s never easy hearing about someone’s life being torn apart by their anomaly, but it’s always worse in situations like this. 6286 never asked to be anomalous, and before the incident in the playground, she may not have even known that she was. She just wanted to play a game of basketball with her friends after school without being heckled by the local bully.
    She doesn’t deserve any of this.

//The incident was reported to the school’s principal, and when the report made its way to Foundation Site 29, two agents were dispatched to 6286’s house in order to bring her into custody and administer necessary amnestics.
Note: the following events have been pieced together from forensic data recovered at the scene.//

    05-1 sighs again; that’s never a good line to read in a report

    //Upon arrival, Foundation agents posing as city police attempted to bring the anomaly into custody, but Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez refused to comply. When they began to actively resist the agents, the latter was forced to execute them.
    In response, SCP-6286 seemed to lose control of her abilities, summoning fire far hotter than she had before, burning the house down. 
    When Site 29 didn’t hear from the two agents for over two hours, they sent more agents to the anomaly’s house as backup. When they arrived, they discovered that the fire had completely destroyed the house, the vehicles parked in the driveway, and all of the equipment inside both, rendering all body cams, audio recorders, etc useless. 
    Five bodies were discovered inside the house. Dental records identified four of them as 6286’s parents and the SCP agents, and while the ME was unable to conclusively identify the fifth one, it was determined that it belonged to a female of the same approximate age, height and race as SCP-6286. Due to these findings, SCP-6286 has been classified as a neutralized anomaly.// 
    
    05-1 grits his teeth in frustration; everything about that situation was absolutely avoidable. There are literally a dozen ways to take an anomaly into custody without raising suspicions or causing collateral damage, a fact that those agents knew and apparently decided to ignore. Now, a house has been burned down and five people are dead. 
At least the fire provided a handy cover story for those deaths.
    05-1 can picture the scene so clearly in his mind; Marie Sanchez was clearly a powerful anomaly capable of summoning fire out of thin air when she was upset or afraid or angry. And he knows that in that moment, with her parents’ blood pooling on her living room floor, that she had never been more upset and afraid and angry in her entire life. There’s no way she could have controlled it, even if she’d wanted to. It just exploded out of her, seeking to destroy those who had murdered her parents and torn her life apart, and it ended up taking her with it.
    Having read the summary, 05-1 skims over the rest of the file, which is mostly various reports on various aspects of the case. 6286’s school transcript and records were included. As he reads them, 05-1 can’t help but be impressed. Even though she was still in primary school, her grades indicated that she had a first-rate mind, particularly when it came to science, technology, and mathematics. 
If she had survived, and proved cooperative in containment, these records alone would have been enough for him to consider recommending that she be recruited into Mobile Task Force Alpha-9. Nicknamed “Last Hope,” MTF Alpha-9 is an…experiment of sorts, meant to replace the failed experiment that was MTF Omega-7, AKA Pandora’s Box. Omega-7 was the first MTF to be made up of humanoid and human-like anomalies that were both cooperative and possessed abilities that could be crucial to containing other, much more dangerous anomalies. Unfortunately, Omega-7 failed miserably due to their inclusion of SCP-076, also known as Abel, a formidable warrior who ultimately proved uncontrollable when the Foundation ran out of targets for him to kill.
The next cluster of reports looks like they were taken from the police investigation into the fire, probably at the same time the police officers involved were given amnestics and false memories.
Unsurprisingly, the cause of death for Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez was ruled to be single gunshots to the head. The reports on the two dead agents, and the SCP herself, however, are more interesting. While the cause of death was ruled as burning, the photographs included with the reports make it very clear that it was no ordinary fire. One photograph in particular sends a bit of a chill down 05-1’s spine: a frontal view of one of the agent’s skulls, with the imprint of a small hand seared into it. Likely one of the last marks 6286 ever left on the world. 
Because 6286’s body was so badly damaged in the fire, there wasn’t much evidence left to document at her post-mortem, except for the extremely poor condition of her body, burnt beyond all recognition by her own inferno, which was recorded as burning three times as hot as a normal wood fire when the Foundation forensics team arrived. The flames were also unable to be extinguished by any ordinary methods, and the operatives had to wait until they had burned themselves out before approaching. 
05-1 closes the file; he’s seen enough. This isn’t his first time reading a report like this, about a botched extraction leading to the death of an anomaly. Some might actually say that it’s better this way. Some might say that it’s better to die quickly than spend the rest of one's life in a containment chamber. 
05-1 sighs and stands up from his desk, crossing to the window. The debate over how to deal with the anomalous can - and probably will - go on forever. It all completely depends on how one sees anomalies: dangerous parathreats, SCPs, nothing but misunderstood creatures who deserve to live their lives as normally as possible, the list goes on.
05-1 opens the window, allowing the sounds of the traffic far below to bleed inside along with a gust of cold air. He leans forward, breathing in the fresh air as he stares out at the city, the many lights coming out of windows mirroring the stairs in the night sky above. 
Debates about containment aside, it is probably for the best that 6286 didn’t make it out of the fire. Just that morning, 05-1 had received a report detailing a radio communication the Foundation had intercepted from a Chaos Insurgency group operating out of the Toluca regions of Mexico, not very far from Mexico City. For an anomaly like 6286, it is almost definitely better to wind up dead than in their hands. The Insurgency makes a habit out of using the anomalies they come across, dragging every ounce of everything even remotely useful out of them before throwing them away like trash. After all, who would know that better than 05-1. He used to be one of them.
    He can still remember all the details of that day, the day he went from being hell-bent on destroying the Foundation -  even sacrificing the lives of some of the people he cared about most in this world - to becoming its staunchest defender. 
    He had been so close, literally seconds away from achieving the goal that so many had fought and bled and died for, and then he just…didn’t. He didn’t destroy the Foundation, just stepped neatly into the power vacuum he’d just created and kept going where the previous 05-1 had left off.
    He had his reasons, good reasons. Reasons he still stands by, even if no one else can understand. And maybe someday, he’ll even be able to stop feeling bad about it.
    And maybe someday, he’ll stop feeling bad about the report he just read. 6286 may have been an anomaly, but she was still a person. Neither she nor her parents deserved what happened to them.
    The Overseer makes a silent promise to her, to SCP 6286, to Marie Sanchez, that he’d do everything he could to keep it from ever happening again. He goes back to his desk and starts drafting a memo to send to the rest of the 05 council, outlining his proposal for a new training regime that each and every member of Foundation personnel should have to go through, emphasizing the importance of using nonlethal force when possible, avoiding collateral damage, and above all, understanding that if they ever find themselves coming back from a mission with innocent blood on their hands - civilian or anomalous - they will have him to answer to.

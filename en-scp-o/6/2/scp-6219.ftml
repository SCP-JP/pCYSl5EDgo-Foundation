**DESCRIPTION:** **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** is the designation given to a hairless and grey-skinned humanoid cadaver approximately 2.5 meters in height. **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** does not possess any reproductive organs or any facial features, and instead has a crude SCP Foundation logo carved into its forehead, with various degrees of burnt marks scattered throughout  **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**'s torso and arms. Although **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** has been in Foundation possession since [DATA EXPUNGED],  **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** has not shown any signs of decay.

**##grey|Abnormality-6219##** is a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242|Class-I Semiontological Anomaly]]][[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]##black|A semiontological anomaly (semiohazard) is a disruption of the Semiosphere (the medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured) which results in reality's apparent adherence to some non-real axiom. These types of anomalies are often handled by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/domc-hub|Department of Miscommunications (DoMC)]]].##[[/span]]. Any subject mentioning  **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**, whether through speech or writing (as such in this document), will refer to **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** as "Abnormality-6219"; instead of its proper SCP designation.

**##grey|Abnormality-6219##** was discovered in a previously sealed-off underground room in Site-58 during a renovation to expand the West Wing of the facility. However, blueprint plans obtained from Site-58's archive shows no mention of the room ever being built.

The underground room contains only the following:

* **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**, lying on the ground with its hands rested on its chest,
* A metal bucket full of an unidentified reddish liquid,
* A metal placard reading "[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3790|Department of Abnormalities]]]",
* Multiple drawings depicting a forested region,
* A long thin silver rod, approximately 1 meter in length,
* A painted stone tablet depicting a flaming iron crown,
* Two (2) golden-brown metal ingots of unknown composition,
* A solid heavy metal door, currently inaccessible as the door's handle and unlocking mechanism was removed prior to discovery.    

**INCIDENT LOG 1:** On █/█/███, the site containing **##grey|Abnormality-6219##** experienced a total power failure, resulting in a massive blackout and multiple Euclid and Keter Class containment breaches[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]##black|This containment breach resulted in 26 injured personnel and 14 casualties with 1 personnel reported to be missing.##[[/span]]. During the blackout, personnel reported hearing soft crying and faint screaming emanating from **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**'s containment chamber.

When the power was subsequently restored on the site, a D-Class was instructed to enter **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**'s containment chamber to examine any structural damage. The D-Class reported nothing out of the ordinary but then noticed a note taped on the chest of **##grey|Abnormality-6219##**. The note is written by a standard graphite pencil and has been designated **Document**-**##grey|Abnormality-6219##****-1**.

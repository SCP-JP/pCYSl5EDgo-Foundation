**Special Containment Procedures:** Uncontained. Must be surveyed twice a week using the Foundational Multiversal Satellite System. No further efforts to containment or interaction are to be made.

**Description:** SCP-6605 refers to a large phenomenon located in Reality-String Section-1A.[[footnote]]Also known as the central dimension of the Multiversal Web.[[/footnote]] SCP-6605 appears to be a massive illuminating gas of bright white light filling up approximately 72% of the space within the Universe holding SCP-6605, expanding by 0.67% each year. Surrounding SCP-6605 is SCP-6605-A, a universal phenomenon that causes the inhabiting universe to be in a perpetual state of slow motion and causes occasional reality distortions to occur frequently. SCP-6605 has the possibility to deconstruct and distort mainline reality whenever physical contact is made, varying at how much force is applied at SCP-6605. Whenever an object enters the field of SCP-6605-A, it will not constitute the same slow motion of effects until direct contact with SCP-6605 has been made with the object. However, this can be overruled if enough force is applied to SCP-6605, in which the object pierces the gas illuminating SCP-6605, and enters its interior structure.

When an object enters SCP-6605's interior structure, it will quickly disintegrate into a white-colored type of Zero-Point Energy with a rate of disintegration at 600 lbs per second. This can be negated if the following item is primed with Ionized Active Uranium, refined in a form where it can output the most amount of radiation possible. The interior of SCP-6605 is extremely cosmically chaotic, and will often combust at random with an explosive force that will instantly destroy all matter within its area. SCP-6605 is the cause of SCP-6605-A's effects, and will often 'distort' and 'reconstruct' matter and reality to great effect. This reality will construct reality in an infinite landscape of suburbs, however, all humans residing in the said area will display highly unusual effects.

Lifeforms designated within SCP-6605-A often distort out of reality at random times, sometimes 'glitch' out of their current standpoint to impossible lengths, appears as a black and purple square-patterned texture, and simply teleport to random areas. Sometimes, all lifeforms will disappear at random, then reappear at different or same locations, visibly doing different activities. Lifeforms within SCP-6605-A do not constitute any threats towards visiting lifeforms within SCP-6605-A. 

SCP-6605-B refers to an recurring event that takes place randomly within a singular universe or dimension. When SCP-6605-B occurs, the affected section will undergo detrimental effects towards its reality stability, Hume levels, reality construct, and dimensional and universal seals. SCP-6605-B has no known neutralization, treatment, or containment procedures and all attempts towards reality stability will fail. SCP-6605-B will appear as a large beam of very bright illuminated gas[[footnote]]Similar in construct towards SCP-6605.[[/footnote]] from an unknown surface portal, and will affect gravity in a way similar towards Black Holes, albeit to a much lesser degree. SCP-6605-B's beam of light will continue to extend on a horizontal scale, and then extend into a vertical scale until SCP-6605-B has completely consumed all space. When all space has been consumed, the universe affected will explode into a mass of highly destructive energy, hereby known as "Pummel Energy." Pummel Energy is made out of mainly Zero-Point energy and a variety of other high-powered energies,[[footnote]]Similar in construct to the particles emitted when objects disintegrate from contact within the interior of SCP-6605.[[/footnote]] that are capable of harming Reality-String-Sections. Usually, Pummel Energy will "pummel" the Reality Strings until either the Strings have completely deteriorated or have run out of all consumable energy. This will result in other dimensions and universes being detached from their appropriate Reality-Strings or will be destroyed entirely by direct hits from Pummel Energy. Reality-String-Sections and universes will only withstand constant attacks from Pummel Energy for 10 years to 17 hours. Mostly depending on the amount of Pummel Energy.

+++ Addendum-6605-PO:
[[/=]]
On 7/8/2031, during daily surveillance of SCP-6605. SCP-6605 appeared to rapidly move in place for 11 minutes with visible electric activity emanating from its core, and shoot out a mass of strings of pure light before said strings began to 'merge' with the Multiversal Web. At the same time, SCP-6605 appeared to slowly pull in all the mass of Reality-String-Section-O, a significant part of the Multiversal Web, and absorb it into its own mass. This set of events did not affect any other Reality-String-Sections, but an unknown device was launched from Reality-String-Section-K6 at a high speed before shortly colliding with SCP-6605, with significant 'shards' shedding from it. Possibly damage.

This then caused SCP-6605 to suddenly explode an enormous mass of Pummel Energy in all directions in a circular forcefield causing significant damage towards the Multiversal web. Reality-String-Section-K6 suffered the most damage from the explosion.

+++ The Vertigo Events:
[[/=]]
At 9/15/2033, SCP-6605 suddenly began rapidly shaking in place, before expunging and entangling bright white electrical currents within SCP-6605 into the majority of the Multiversal Web. This caused no damage within the Reality-String-Sections, however, they have begun to slowly reconstruct themselves into various shapes and occasionally detach from the entirety of the Multiversal Web, then reattaching. At the same time, SCP-6605 become extremely unstable, and further shook in place rapidly before losing approximately 30% of its mass. Four days later, SCP-6605 then suddenly rapidly reduced its size the size of approximately a small golf ball. It stayed in this state for 3 minutes before broadcasting a signal identified as Static Noise across the Multiverse for several hours. Finally, it then began to take on the appearance of Static Noise, instead of its usual illuminated appearance.

This reconstruction of Reality-Strings continued for the duration of thirteen days before coming at a stop at 8:08 PM EST. After all activity, all strings were put back in their original state, and no further activity was observed from SCP-6605.

> Dr. Taccory: Interesting find, Zeran. How exactly did you find this?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Wasn't that hard to find when the point was expelling larger amounts of energy in the first place. Took me a few days to get the correct visualization structure. But, after 308 repeated attempts, this was what the computer was certain to visualize.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: I see...do you have any idea of what exactly this means?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Well, I've boiled it down towards a single theory, however, I can assure you that this theory is the most plausible and most likely valid.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: Well, let's hear them then.
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Well to begin my first hypothesis, I've already concluded that this has no relation to any known Extramultiversal anomalies. However, an 'Extraomniversal' anomaly would be the appropriate name to call this...event.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: Extraomniversal anomalies...wouldn't that be something from inside the Static? We have already concluded that-
> 
> Dr. Zeran: You misunderstand Doctor. It is the Static.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: The Static is making an entrance inside the Core? I thought we had been dealt with the Static before.
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Allow me to explain. When the mid-stages of the Vertigo Events first occurred, we first noticed patterns and frequencies similar in noise and type towards that of Static Noise. Normally, we concluded that all the way up until now- that the existence of Static Noise was the cause of an unknown frequency emanating from an untraceable extramultiversal anomaly, while it also possibly being the Static Noise itself, or related to it. So this means when the Core entered its critical state, it was somehow opening a portal to the outskirts of the Omniverse, or at least picked up a frequency from it.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: And how exactly did this 'portal' open?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Well, that may have been caused by Variable-KO6.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: The missile that achieved such a staggering speed that engaged contact with the Core? There's no way the Missile would have been able to bypass the Cores disintegration defense systems, armoring systems, and then manually bypass the most classified credentials.
> 
> Dr. Zeran: It wasn't a missile, sir. It was a trojan. It was hauling data that would allow it to bypass many of the security systems. Something alarming, however, Inner-multiversal beings are very underestimated nowadays.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: And how did it survive the disintegration auto defense systems then?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: It was coated in Ionized Uranium.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: And the armor systems?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: It was the first-ever Inner-multiversal owned object to achieve Keterean[[footnote]]The speed level required to travel the Omniverse efficiently.[[/footnote]] levels of speed. A very fascinating feat for an Inner-multiversal entity to achieve. To do something such as that would need cooperation from multiple alternate universes. Which is something especially weird considering most Foundation-Occupied Multiverses, especially ones such as this one, never make efforts to combine their infinite knowledge and resources and make further advancements as a unified conglomerate. Monov-
> 
> Dr. Taccory: Ms. Zeran, please stay on topic. Now could you further explain this hypothesis?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: My apologies, Dr. Taccory. As I was explaining, whatever device was sent into the Core somehow used a highly-advanced decryption device that would allow the Core to plant a coordinated portal to a random place within the Static Void. Now, unfortunately, we don't know why they did this, or how they knew so much about the Core's true purpose due their destruction. However, we have most likely predicted that they were attempting to do something else entirely...most likely neutralize it, and ended up doing something else entirely. Now, for what exactly came out of Static Portal...well...we aren't exactly sure.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: What do you mean?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: This entity is something similar to a...curious child. Like, it's as if it was just born and the first object it saw after being born, was the trojan missile, and decided to...well...learn from it, or somehow 'absorb its information.' When it first manifested the first thing it absorbed was most likely the missile launched at it. Since this missile had information about the attackers, it possibly wanted to be or learn more about the "logo" embedded upon the rocket. This anomaly simply took control of the Core and began to reconstruct it in its own image. Like something of a child copying the acts of what's on TV.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: And this entity is expected to make further activity?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Oh, very plausible indeed. As a matter of fact, I think it will in the next time period or so. If this thing is somewhat of a curious entity that 'replicates,' 'copies,' and possibly even interact with the things it is fascinated with, we may consider the possibility of surveying and quarantining the area instead of exterminating it or make direct experiments upon it. Unless it begins to cause further problems, of course.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: And how did it gain control over the Core so easily?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: We don't know, but it may have been done using Static Transmission, or something similar. Sadly, we couldn't obtain much information about the entity due to protocol and quarantine reasons.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: I see. This is a great deal of information you have given me, Ms. Zeran. I appreciate it. This was quite the discussion, so this meeting will be dismissed. I will give you further updates on what the higher-ups decide to do with the anomaly as soon as possible.
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Of course, Dr. Taccory. I look forward to our next meeting.
> 
> Dr. Taccory: Oh, and one last thing. Could you tell me what exactly this group the 'entity' is so beloved with, and the current reformed Multiversal Structure of the Vertigo Multiverse?
> 
> Dr. Zeran: Of course. Here.

> You haven't been answering our emails for the past week, Zeran. You have failed to tell us exactly what SCP-6605 is, the Vertigo Events. Per our agreements, you must share information with your allied universe as long as it is not Monoversal classified information. We doubt this is classified information, and see no need of classifying this information, as we have been promised the sufficient information about SCP-6605. We hope you will not ignore this email, as we do not want to bother the C.S.T. Neither would you.

> I very much so apologize for the avoidance of emails for the past week, as both I and my team have been very busy working on the SCP-6605 Catalyst Project. Since I do not have time for meetings, I'll give you a very brief information sweep regarding SCP-6605.
> 
> SCP-6605, to put it simply, is the largest Scranton Reality Anchor in the Omniverse. And we created it for you. As any other anchor, it stabilizes reality around your Multiverse and makes sure no major Reality-Related effects happen upon the Multiversal Web that would harm it. When's the last time you've seen a Reality-Bender actually have been born since 2000? Or after the Ichabod Campaign? Ever wonder why the lack of any reality-bending entities manifesting? Their manifestations have been completely been neutralized because of SCP-6605. Reality-Benders no longer affect large areas, and their powers are confined to a few miles or less, adding to that; SCP-6605 has made it utterly impossible for Reality-Benders to be born because of it. 
> 
> That's not the only thing it does. It also keeps the Great Abyss from leaking, creating dangerous Anomalies, and most important of all, creating a near-impenetrable barrier for your Multiverse to protect from Extramultiversal threats. It's the main reason why you will never see an Extramultiversal entity ever manifest in your Multiverse, why anomalies spawn rates have nearly been cut in half, and why so many god-crazy heretics are rarely ever able to summon their own "eldritch abominations". We created one for each Multiverse to protect the internal lives of your inhabitants and has done a very well job to keep Multiverses from destabilizing. Or the very worse, violating the Omniversal Laws. It is very viable to your existence and survival, and it is of utmost importance that you no longer interfere with it further. As said in the containment procedures.
> 
> As for SCP-6605-B, this is a small cost for the Core to actually run and power itself without affecting its peak performance. There's always a setback for miracles, and I think you know that too.
> 
> Unfortunately, the "Vertigo Events" has complicated things with your specific Core, however, we are hard at work with fixing these complications to prevent any incidents from occurring! So, no need for any worries as SCP-6605 has not affected your Multiverse in any significant ways, and you are completely safe by all means!

> Salutations,

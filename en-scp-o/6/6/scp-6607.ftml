**Addendum 6607-1: SCP-2791**

[[[SCP-2791]]] was a network of anomalous processes created by ITCD Bank's Extraglobal Operations division to manipulate demonic contracts, using the profits of its contracts to cancel out their associated prices at an overall net gain. Shortly after containment began, the Foundation determined that SCP-2791's system was unsustainable and attempted to de-escalate the number and scope of its component contracts. On 02/13/2022, shortly after SCP-2791 reached its 500 million oath milestone, it was determined that neutralization through de-escalation was not possible.

Projections indicated that SCP-2791 would become uncontainable within 3 months, at which point it would rapidly destabilize and enter an Oath Cascade Event. Its component contracts would all simultaneously resolve, leading to the immediate seizure of 89% of all living souls on Earth, 24% of Earth's land mass, and three undetermined planets from our solar system.

Members of the Legal Department and Tactical Theology Department were mobilized to find an alternative method of containment or neutralization.

**Salazar:** You’re late.

**Katz:** Nice to see you too, Amaya. //[Pause.]// You must be Mrs. Fatish Von Trevil.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Pleasure to meet you.

//[Katz and Fatish Von Trevil shake hands.]//

**Katz:** Likewise. My name is--

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I know who you are, Mr. Katz.

**Katz:** You do?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** My old mentor speaks highly of you. I believe you would know him as... what was his designation?

//[Adrian flips through a notepad.]//

**Adrian:** [[[SCP-738]]].

//[Katz's left eye twitches twice.]//

**Katz:** Ah. Yes. Him.

**Katz:** Moving right along.

**Salazar:** Let's start by getting the obvious questions out of the way. Sheldon, are we absolutely certain that there's no legal loophole for to get us out of this?

**Katz:** Yes and no. We have plenty of experience in nullifying anomalous contracts-- but voiding even one oath would disrupt the delicate balance of 2791's system. It would only further destabilize the anomaly.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I concur with Mr. Katz’s assessment.

**Salazar:** What about you, Mrs. Fatish Von Trevil? Do you have a plan in mind for us?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I do not have //a// plan, what sort of amateur do you take me for? I have //twenty-seven// plans.

**Salazar:** Go ahead.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** It has come to my attention that the Foundation has access to formidable cross-universe transportation technology. I suggest we use it to divert the prices invoked by SCP-2791 to an alternate Earth.

**Katz:** Not possible. It would be a direct violation of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5618 Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981]. Besides, there's no way the Ethics Committee would allow it.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I would assume that this committee would be equally displeased about other forms of mass death?

**Katz:** You assume correctly.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Pause.]// Motion to dismiss my prior statement regarding my number of plans.

**Salazar:** I’ll allow it.

**Katz:** Amaya, your people kill gods all the time. Could we stop Hell by force?

**Salazar:** Yes, theoretically. But even if we pulled it off, it would be self-defeating. Hell is a crucial part of the greater cosmos. Damaging or destroying the system of Hell would be like altering a law of physics; the ramifications are unimaginable.

**Katz:** What other recourse do we have?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** There is one remaining path. Do you know of the Infernal Revenue Service?

**Salazar:** Of course-- it's the regulatory body responsible for the governance and enforcement of demonic contracts.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Yes. The IRS alone possesses the authority to nullify each of SCP-2791's contracts simultaneously, neutralizing the anomaly without inducing a cascade event.

**Katz:** That's not feasible. We'd need to offer assets of significantly greater value than what ITCD Bank's assorted contractors would be receiving. What could we-- could //anyone// --provide that's worth more than nearly every soul on the planet?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** We //are// representing a bank, are we not? We shall pay them in installments.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I am rather surprised that the Foundation has not found a way to automate this process.

**Salazar:** //[Chuckling.]// Only a handful of days working here and you already know us so well. We tried that, but it turns out the act of inscribing by hand is part of it-- the human element is crucial for this kind of thaumaturgy.

**Salazar:** Besides, I think Entity-AG02 would be offended if he found out he had been summoned by a machine and his yelling gives me cluster headaches.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** About him-- why have you chosen Duke Agares for this transaction?

**Salazar:** Because our human thaumaturges don't have enough collective firepower to get something of this scale done within our time frame. Do you think he's unsuitable?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** No. He has a reputation for reliable spellwork. I am surprised that you would take such a risk-- Dukes of Hell are known for a certain cruelty in the prices they demand of their summoners. Even turning down their offered bargains has its own grisly cost.

**Salazar:** This one is a... unique case. He was involved in an incident that led to the founding of Tactical Theology and ended up metaphysically tethered to the department. We get his services at a premium.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** It is known that he can grant the power to draw a fugitive back into their cage. Could this be the Foundation's influence?

**Salazar:** Probably. These connections go both ways.

//[Salazar completes Sigil-AG02.]//

**Salazar:** There. Are you ready?

**Entity-AG02:** Ah, I am glad to see your face once more, doctor of the Foundation. How long has it been since my last summoning?

**Salazar:** Seven months, give or take.

**Entity-AG02:** And what's this? Could it be little Primrose in the flesh once more?

//[Fatish Von Trevil bows slightly.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Stiffly.]// I am honored, Duke Agares.

**Entity-AG02:** Quite a nasty bit of work you did on yourself. //[Laughing.]// I've heard of getting lost in a book, but I believe you took that a mite too far, wouldn't you say?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Some would say so, yes.

**Entity-AG02:** How diplomatically worded! Perhaps you would've been better off in your father's line of work rather than the law.

//[Fatish Von Trevil's ambient temperature increases.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Perhaps.

**Entity-AG02:** But I distract myself from the matter at hand; what has compelled you to summon me to your illustrious concrete halls, good doctor? Could it have anything to do with the Bank of ITCD?

**Salazar:** You already know about it?

**Entity-AG02:** How couldn't I? They practically contracted half of Hell for their little scheme. //[Chuckling.]// I should've known the Foundation would end up neck-deep in it.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Then you understand that we seek an alternative solution.

**Salazar:** We need you to create a set of thaumaturgic rituals to continuously generate power for ITCD's contractors.

**Entity-AG02:** Hmmm.

 //[Entity-AG02 is quiet for 8 seconds, stroking its beard.]//

**Entity-AG02:** What's the catch? Surely you could manage such a thing-- not as easily as I, certainly, but you speak of rather standard magic.

**Salazar:** I was about to get to that-- we need to be able to remotely control the anomalous effects of these rituals after performing them.

 //[Entity-AG02 claps its hands.]//

**Entity-AG02:** Ah, //there's// the controlling autocrats I adore! You can't bear to create something you're unable to control, can you?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** What will be your price, Duke of Hell?

**Entity-AG02:** Oh, you need not give me a single thing.

**Salazar:** What?

**Entity-AG02:** All I ask for is your gratitude... and 3% of all power born of these rituals.

Which is to say, I speak for the Gehennan Parliament, the Garden of Unearthly Delights, Mammon Industries™, and a wide assortment of independent demons, devils, fiends, imps, succubi, incubi, profane spirits, walking blasphemies, and possessed dolls.

**Entity-6607:** Now... what do you have in mind for us today, Rosebud? What do have to give us that's more valuable than all of Neptune?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** We possess no such thing.

**Entity-6607:** Go on.

**Katz:** We're not here for a trade of assets. We're here to provide you a business offer.

//[Fatish Von Trevil hands a stack of documents describing each SCP-6607 instance (with the exception of SCP-6607-1) in detail to Adrian, who brings it to Entity-6607. Entity-6607 begins reading it.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** In exchange for the nullification of all of ITCD Bank's current contracts, we shall set these rituals into motion.

//[Entity-6607 does not respond for 3.5 minutes as it continues to read at a rapid pace. Afterwards, it tosses the stack of documents onto the table.]//

**Entity-6607:** You're //lo//sing your touch, Rosebud. These profits aren't bad, but they're peanuts in comparison to what is already owed.

**Katz:** Try to keep in mind the length of Foundation's reach-- our influence exceeds nearly all other earthly authorities. We'll be able to push each ritual's influence to a global scale.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Look again to page 213. It has detailed estimations of how much energy each ritual can produce under such conditions. Within a single century, we will have generated an equivalent amount of power for your clients. 

**Adrian:** With 30% interest!

**Entity-6607:** I sup//pose// that's not entirely terrible-- but I want an upfront payment in addition to what you're offering. Something significant. My people will need proof that you're serious about this.

**Adrian:** You want even more?!

**Entity-6607:** And I won't even consider accepting this agreement until I get it, dearest.

**Katz:** You're bluffing. ITCD's contracts might be a large profit for Hell, but we both know you need us humans alive, long-term. Destroy the world and you'll have nothing left to feed upon. No acquisition is worth that much.

//[Fatish Von Trevil places a hand on Katz's shoulder.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Mr. Katz--

**Entity-6607:** Do you //rea//lly think that humans are our only clientele? That we would limit our efforts to your little ball of water and gas?

**Entity-6607:** There are planets where the edicts of devils stand above all others. There are great starfaring ships that skip from galaxy to galaxy through blood and profane science. There are Dyson spheres of stygian iron that encircle hellfire stars.

**Entity-6607:** The universe is wide and strange, little lawyer, and you cannot begin to comprehend Hell's place in it.

**Entity-6607:** Is Earth valuable to us? Of course! But it's hardly //in//valuable.

//[Katz glances at Fatish Von Trevil to confirm the veracity of Entity-6607's statement. Fatish Von Trevil nods.]//

**Katz:** I'll need a moment to confer with my superiors.

**Entity-6607:** //Cer//tainly-- we have all the time in the world, after all.

[[/div]]

Katz shortly gained signed permission for the surrender of several high-value demonic objects and entities to GoI-066's custody upon the signing of the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords. Negotiation of the Accords' exact terms began shortly afterward. As negotiations carried on for nearly 19 hours, the majority of proceedings has been redacted for the sake of brevity.

[[div class="blockquote"]]

**Katz:** The amendment you added to paragraph 3 of subsection 7A is unacceptable.

**Entity-6607:** What//ever// do you mean? All that does is lower the owed quantity of "FSE" by a rather significant amount. I was doing Rosebud a favor, for old times' sake. That's all.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** A //favor//? You would lower our FSE debt in exchange for every soul in Florida.

**Entity-6607:** It'd be doing the world a favor, if you ask me.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I did not ask. Remove it.

**Entity-6607:** As you say, darling.

[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]

**Entity-6607:** I have some more revisions for you to look over.

**Katz:** //[Pause.]// Do any of these revisions consign people to hell?

**Entity-6607:** Define "people."

[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]

**Katz:** //[Examining revision 84-A of the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords.]// Look at this, Trevil. This isn't legal, right?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Pause.]// I am surprised, Marion. I never thought you would partake in such a glaring error.

**Entity-6607:** Are you sure about that?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I am certain. You know well that I have memorized all laws and regulations regarding infernal contracts. I have read them countless times.

**Entity-6607:** Read them again.

//[Entity-6607 snaps its fingers. A long parchment scroll materializes in its other hand in a burst of fire. It hands the scroll to Fatish Von Trevil, who reads its contents.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** An amendment was made.... less than a day ago? And it has already come into effect? Was this your doing?

**Entity-6607:** //[Examining its nails.]// I might have called in a few favors.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** This amendment is small, but its consequences spread far-- we have many revisions to make, Mr. Katz.

**Adrian:** I'll get more coffee.

**Katz:** Please do.

[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]

**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Whispering.]// Do you understand my trepidation regarding Marion, now?

**Katz:** //[Whispering.]// Yes... To think I'd miss 738. God.

**Entity-6607:** Did you two say something?

**Katz:** No.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Of course not.

[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]

//[Agent Kirchner enters Conference Room B. She appears to be slightly out of breath.]//

**Kirchner:** Site-666 is under attack-- we're seeing sudden bursts in demonic activity all over Undervegas. I'm here to bring both of you to the nearest safe room.

**Katz:** I'll be staying here, Agent.

**Kirchner:** I don't think you understand--

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Marion.

**Entity-6607:** Yes, Rosebud?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Stop. This. Now.

//[A distant explosion is audible and the room slightly shakes.]//

**Entity-6607:** I don't //poss//ibly know what you mean! I have nothing to do with any of this. Not in any way that would be admissible as evidence.

**Fatish Von Trevil:** //Marion.//

**Entity-6607:** I'd be happy to lend my assistance, of course. Help you smooth this all over. Though, I won't be able to do a //thing// until we get these Accords signed...

//[Fatish Von Trevil stands up abruptly, knocking over her chair. An ornate trident materializes in her hands.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Continue working, Mr. Katz. I will resolve the situation.

**Katz:** Shouldn't we leave that to the soldiers?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** Have you read my file? I have experience as both a mercenary and diplomatic liaison.

**Katz:** Do you intend to make peace with our attackers or...?

**Fatish Von Trevil:** I suppose that is up to them, is it not?

//[Fatish Von Trevil walks past Kirchner and exits the room. 25 seconds later, distant  inhuman screams become audible.]//

**Katz:** So, I have some concerns about subsection 21A.

//[Conference Room B shakes more forcefully.]//

**Katz:** Let's talk about that.

[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]

//[Conference Room B's lights are dimmed, due to Site-666 having switched to auxiliary power. Significant structural damage is visible. Fatish Von Trevil is covered in blood, none of it her own. Katz's left eye is twitching uncontrollably.]//

**Fatish Von Trevil:** We are done, yes?

**Entity-6607:** It seems you haven't lost your touch after all, Rosebud.

//[Entity-6607 signs the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords.]//

**Entity-6607:** Let's do this again sometime. Ciao!

//[Entity-6607 dematerializes in a burst of fire and smoke. The smoke floats towards the ceiling and activates the room's sprinklers. Fatish Von Trevil, Katz, and Adrian do not attempt to leave.]//

**Katz:** I... //fucking// hate the IRS.

**Adrian:** We all do, buddy. We all do.

//[The ceiling collapses.]//

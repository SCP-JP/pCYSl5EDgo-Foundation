**Object Class:** Phenomenon

**Description:** SCP-6961 is the designation given to an anomalous event that spontaneously occurred on the 5th of May, 2018, where a large-winged humanoid entity suddenly manifested approximately 200 meters atop Vatican City in Rome, Italy.

During this event, the entity (hereafter known as SCP-6961-A) vocalized loudly in English to the individuals below for several seconds, before entirely demanifesting from the Vatican. The following is a transcript of the event, initially recorded via a civilian's phone:

[[div class="blockquote"]]

= **<Begin Log>**

//The camera is pointed upwards towards the sky, taking in several of the City's domed structures and carved architectures.//

//A sudden bright light obscures the lenses of the camera, and the recorder of the footage stumbles a bit. When the light subsides, SCP-6961-A can be seen floating in the sky, with its head bowed in a gesture of supplication.//

//The entity raises its head to face the individuals below and begins to vocalize.//

**SCP-6961-A:** BEHOLD, MORTALS! FOR I BEAR A CRUCIAL MESSAGE FROM YOUR LORD!

//SCP-6961-A manifests a roll of parchment in its right hand and unfurls it.//

**SCP-6961-A:** (//clears throat//) "It's pronounced 'Shee-zus'. Please get it right next time."

//The parchment disappears.//

**SCP-6961-A:** THAT CONCLUDES THE LORD'S CRUCIAL MESSAGE! MAY HIS WISE WORDS GUIDE YOU TO THE RIGHTFUL PATH!

//SCP-6961-A bows down to a nearby cross before demanifesting itself.//

= **<End Log>**

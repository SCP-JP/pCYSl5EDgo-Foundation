**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6929 is to be contained in a standard containment locker at Site-19. Testing access to the anomaly is to be decided at the discretion of the head researcher. Any testing done to discern its odor should not involve overly spraying or pouring SCP-6929 such that it wastes the quantity of perfume within it.

**Description:** SCP-6929 is a half-used bottle of unbranded perfume. Under normal circumstances, SCP-6929 has the properties of normal perfume and is able to be used without any unusual effects. However, on specific dates, SCP-6929â€™s odor changes, with certain emotions being associated with each odor regardless of the prior experiences of the person smelling it (See Addendum 6929.1).

As of now, the cause for SCP-6929's effects, as well as any possible meaning behind its influence on the association of certain emotions, remain unknown.

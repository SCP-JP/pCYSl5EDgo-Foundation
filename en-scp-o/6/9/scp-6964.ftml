**Item #:** SCP-6964

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6964 remains moored in the location of its discovery. Satellite imagery is monitored and doctored to remove it. The //SCPS Crowhurst// is to patrol the local waters under the guise of a research vessel to monitor it, as well as intercept and dissuade non-Foundation ships, warning them of dangerous waters. Resistance should be met with amnesticisation.

**Description:** SCP-6964 is the //MV Asmodeus//, a medium-sized fishing vessel, anchored at latitude -██° ██ ██.██" S. longitude: ███° ██' █.██" E., ██ nautical miles off the coast of Australia in the Coral Sea. It was found drifting in the area by a civilian ship.

On the lower decks are two sleeping quarters. One is unremarkable, with four bunks. The other has had a sheet of metal welded over the entrance. A small streak of blood is visible near the top. Access is impossible. All attempts to image the interior have failed.

**Addendum 1:** The inquiry into the days before and reasons for SCP-6964's abandonment was led by the combined efforts of Agent Teddy Elekana, Dr. Eliza Crozier and Researcher Victor Fernandez. Their reports have been included.

**__Part one: Background to events (Agent Elekana)__**

The //Asmodeus// began life as the //Esther//, named for the wife of original owner Scott Mackenzie. He purchased it in 1956 and used it to supply his shops, but hiring of "unskilled" (read: exploited) immigrants, who were given as much training as he was (sat safe and sound in his cosy office), led to the //Esther// running aground in March 1957. Three people were killed in the incident: Dequan Lu, Albert Wong and Lixue Xun. Unsurprisingly, Mackenzie was not held responsible for the pointless deaths of three human beings, but the hit to his supply combined with already present financial issues led to him facing bankruptcy.
 
Despite not being remotely seaworthy, the //Esther// was sold in November for a ridiculous fee. That the vessel went to close friend Ralph McShane did not go unnoticed, but no financial misdeeds could be proven. It was him who renamed her, presumably partially due to his amateur interest in Jewish mysticism and partially due to the potential awkwardness of owning a ship named after his mate's wife. Either unable or uninterested in restoring her to her intended purpose, McShane hulked the //Asmodeus// and hosted lavish parties aboard. The main attraction came at midnight, when he would lead a séance in an attempt to contact the crewmen who had died there.

How serious (or successful) they were is a mystery, but the partying continued until McShane's death (at his wife's hand, unsurprisingly) in 1962. Many of his assets went up for auction, including the //Asmodeus//, which was purchased cheap by Toby Mallory.

Mallory's tenure as owner, and in fact Mallory himself, are of some interest. Had this inquiry had sufficient resources, they could be for reasons other than their nonexistence. I could establish that he spoke with a Southern American accent - a great deal of time-consuming effort uncovered a birth of the same name in Blairsville, Georgia (the US state), in 1923, which would probably fit - but I found no other records of his life until his purchase. No-one seems to know him, he just doesn't exist.

At any rate, he clearly restored the //Asmodeus// to functionality over the next two years, as on 12/04/64, he put out an advert recruiting crew for a one-off ten-day journey, offering each $1,500 (an exorbitant amount). Shockingly, he'd assembled a full complement in a matter of days, and apparently wasn't too choosy, given captain Rodney Hayes had been sacked from his last job for selling off cargo to line his own pockets under his boss' nose. Still, by 01/05/64, they departed from Moreton Bay, Brisbane: Hayes, three crewmen, Mallory, and two extra unidentified passengers.

And unfortunately, that's where the trail ends. The last radio transmission received was a standard coordinates report on the fifth day of their fateful voyage, which would place them about forty miles from the nearest landmass. There'd been one sighting since; amateur sailor Sally Tkachenko reported her barreling past her trimaran at a rate of knots two days after. We believe the ship was abandoned shortly after, which would mean she had been drifting for about a week before her discovery, but it's unclear; she may already have been a ghost ship by the time Tkachenko had her encounter.

I appreciate how vague and lacking this report is. If I'd had more time and manpower, perhaps we could be clearer, but of course, I understand that the Foundation doesn't want to waste too much money on something that might not even be anomalous. And for that, I leave you in Eliza's capable hands.

**__Part two: Ship details (Dr. Crozier)__**

Melodramatic as the name may be, it was the most demonic thing about the //Asmodeus//. No irrefutably anomalous phenomena occurred during our time aboard the ship: nothing spectral, nothing spaciotemporal, nothing memetic, nothing cognitohazardous... Some of the agents who made first contact reported high levels of dread and anxiety regarding the ship, but after extensive interviews and tests led by Fernandez, we conclude this to be a natural response under the circumstances, regardless of what some of them insist.[[footnote]]As a side note, we strongly recommend the introduction of emotional intelligence training for field agents. It does no good to have men unable to handle or express emotions when, say, dealing with emotion-centred anomalies.[[/footnote]] Only the door poses any mysteries.

So, although we cannot rule out nefarious action, we may, refreshingly, be able to turn to more mundane reasons for the //Asmodeus// becoming a derelict. Several abnormalities were noted:

* No lifejackets were present; four had initially been logged.

* A Carley life raft and dinghy were both absent.

* One metre of steel chain was hooked to the stern; the rest appeared to have been roughly severed.

* Bloodied gauze and tape was discovered in the kitchen, with a single severed thumb tip.

* The starboard engine had blown completely, and the portside engine had sustained damage too. Sabotage has been ruled out.

As for what actually happened? I could speculate, but an account would help. For that, I refer you on to Victor.

- Dr. Eliza F. Crozier

**__Part three: On-board testimony (Researcher Fernandez)__**

I feel that my job was at once the easiest and most difficult of the three. The only real account of events after they'd set sail was Captain Hayes's log, and even that is sparse and obtuse. I've done the best I can to establish some sort of narrative from it, but I don't pretend it's not confused and incomplete, or that its cast is sufficiently characterised. Even his memoirs at home were of little help.

It's worth noting that the book had "GET OFF THIS SHIP" scrawled on the front.

He was too ill at the time to apply for first-mate duties, and could provide little useful information - Fernandez[[/footnote]] was here. Four passengers is too many, don't like there being the same number of them as us. Mallory thinks he's the Queen or something.

And that's the only information regarding events onboard that we have.

- Fernandez

**__Part four: Hypothesis__**

Drawing from what we have pieced together, we tentatively suggest the following narrative:

Mallory chose to purchase and repair the //Asmodeus// in order to undertake a voyage of unknown purpose, possibly occult in nature. He was patient enough to complete these repairs, but desperate enough to offer an exorbitant fee for the necessary services.[[footnote]]Perhaps he needed the ship for its tragic past, and the timing held some significance.[[/footnote]] They would journey for five days to an undetermined location, possibly where some sort of ritual took place, and then return.

That, at least, was what Hayes was led to believe. What took place frightened the crew, with nearly a hundred years of experience between them, into turning tail and running. We believe that the engine damage was a result of the ship moving at full speed for far longer than its inexpertly-repaired engines were able to handle.

At this point, things become unclear. The crew seem to have abandoned the three passengers somewhere[[footnote]]It is worth mentioning that either of the escape ships would have carried the full complement.[[/footnote]] and fled at full speed. Further panic then ensued; either they discovered something in the cabin and tried to seal it in, or they found it sealed and its anomalous properties persuaded them to abandon ship.

The whereabouts of Hayes and his crew are unknown. If they left after the engines blew, they may still be drifting, but unless they've washed ashore to food and shelter, their chances of survival are slim. If, in the grip of fear, they tried to leave with the ship still moving at that speed, they're almost certainly dead.

As for the three passengers, beyond guessing where they were abandoned from the theorised destination, we must be frank - we have no idea.

Nevertheless, we recommend keeping an eye on the //Asmodeus//. An open door to a nightmare is somehow less frightening than a locked one.

- Elekana, Crozier and Fernandez


**Addendum 17:** Whilst trawling SCP-6964's presumed coordinates at the time of its abandonment, the //SCPS Crowhurst// discovered a Carley life raft floating in place. An eighteen-metre steel cable was hooked to it, roughly severed at the other end.

On the raft were three heavily charred corpses. DNA testing was inconclusive, although [DATA EXPUNGED], with predictably high resultant levels of █████ radiation. Cause of death in all three cases was determined to be complete organ failure.

All attempts to move the raft failed. Personnel who went aboard reported inexplicable feelings of dread. Ignoring instructions, agents on-site evacuated and unsuccessfully attempted to sink the raft. No attempts to return to the site have been made.

**Addendum 18:** Simultaneous to the events of Addendum 17, staff who were aboard SCP-6964 performing a set of checks prior to permanent abandonment reported similar emotions.[[footnote]]Agent Elekana fainted, but sustained no serious injury.[[/footnote]] When they recovered, they discovered the metal plate had been sheared away by an unknown force. The room beyond had been devastated by fire, with "SHOULD'VE FELT THE LOVE" etched into the ash on the floor. Also within was an indeterminate mass of cells, 1.7m long, mostly consisting of various soft tissues, with a hard internal scaffolding and keratin growths. The postmortem found no cause of death, as it had never been alive.

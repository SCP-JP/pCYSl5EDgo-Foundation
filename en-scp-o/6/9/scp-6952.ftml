**Item #:** SCP-6952

**Object Class:** Euclid 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation web crawlers are to hack and install firewalls within ISPs across the globe in order to block access to SCP-6952, while also tracing IPs of those who have editing privileges on the website. Once an editor has been identified, MTF Sigma-27 ("Copyright Trolls") is to be deployed to capture the editor and retrieve any device pertaining to the operation of the wiki.

Due to SCP-6952 affecting all current copies of an affected media, Foundation agents embedded in production companies are to release press statements when a fictional medium is converted into SCP-6952-A, explaining it as a new update to an existing digital work. If the media is unable to be affected by digital patch, Foundation web crawlers are to spread non anomalous “Mandela effect” memes to sow doubt on the memories of those not affected by instances of SCP-6952-A.

At this current time, widespread amnesticization protocols are not to be adopted due to the sheer number of individuals who would need amnestics as well as the high probability of reinfection upon future media consumption of SCP-6952-A entities.

As of June-6-2022, all methods at the disposal of the Pataphysics Department are to be used in apprehending SCP-6952 admin, PoI-6940 including using protocol "Flame War"[[footnote]] Engaging ex-members of GaW through wiki edits to slip their locations [[/footnote]]. PoI-6940 is considered to be persona non grata with GoI-5869 and is therefore highly unpredictable and dangerous.


**Description:** SCP-6952 is the website https://[REDACTED]fanon.fandom.com/wiki/Home. It was believed to have been first established on Jan-12-2022 by a former member of GoI-5869 "[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-hub Gamers Against Weed]": PoI-6940 also known by the handle “PeppaPigsStrongestSoldier1337”. SCP-6952 itself appears like any other Fanon Wiki that exists on the Fandom site, a place where users can come up with their own original characters and post them on the page; creating entire story lines and worlds for existing media.

SCP-6952, through anomalous means, can be used to add fictional characters to any existing work of fiction, provide new details to existing characters, and overall perceptions by the audience of new characters become reality in accordance with the wiki's description pages. Those who have previously viewed a work before it was anomalously edited will have no memory of the change until that work is viewed again. 

Upon viewing the modified work which will now be referred to in this document as an SCP-6952-A entity, the following effect will occur. If a certain perception was specified on the Fanon Wiki, subjects who view SCP-6952-A will believe that SCP-6952-A always existed in it’s current form and hold any opinion specified on the wiki with only mildly varying results. If no public perception or opinion was included with the fanon wiki page, subjects will note that they experience a sense of suspicion about the new character and are unsure if they were there before.

If the character was added to a work that has sequels, there is the potential effect that they will also persist through these works granted that the wiki author has specified this. In already existing sequels of a franchise that lack a wiki article, the new characters will be incorporated as though they had been written by the original production team of said sequels.

Standard accounts made on the wiki have the ability to edit and make new articles. The Wiki appears to have a form of anomalous spambot protection that prevents articles from being filled with garbage as a way of counteracting the effects of sabotage. The Wiki also contains rules against having pages with no text on them or without a specified media, and the article will not be published unless it fits the criteria; leaving the article's initial effects intact.

Currently it is theorized that deletion of the articles would revert SCP-6952-A entities back to non-anomalous media and thus the retrieval of the servers is a top priority.

> **A note on interaction with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3167 SCP-3167]:** Early in our studies with SCP-6952 we wondered if the creation of SCP-6952-A Entities would spur SCP-3167 into attempting to kill them to respect the author's wishes. After contacting Pataphysics Task Force Alpha-4, they informed us that SCP-3167 had left the newly created characters alone. It is currently unknown if SCP-6952 can manipulate SCP-3167 into killing -6952-A entities or existing fictional characters.
> 
> Perhaps 6952 has a memetic effect on the authors in which they believe they are the progenitor of the changes seen in 6952-A entities. Further testing is necessary on this subject.
> - Researcher Chudley.


**Discovery:**  SCP-6952 was discovered on April 1st 2022 when Dr. Victoria Cerise arrived at Site-78’s Pataphysics Department to visit a friend when Dr. Cerise mentioned she had just rewatched the film, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and spoke positively about a cameo about her favorite character Glup Shitto. Lead researcher Greg Chudley who, being an intermittent Star Wars fan, was a bit confused. He stated that couldn’t remember any character named Glup Shitto, and assumed she was making a joke until Dr. Cerise adamantly defended what she considered to be "the greatest fictional character of her time." A cursory google search by researcher Chudley discovered the [REDACTED] Fanon Wiki with the exact description provided by Dr. Cerise, including her statement of Glup Shitto being "the greatest fictional character of our time."

Dr. Cerise was then thoroughly interviewed to determine if she had consumed any other media that had been converted into SCP-6952-A entities to which it was found she hadn’t heard of anything else written on the Fanon Wiki. The [REDACTED] Fanon Wiki was then quickly classified as SCP-6952, and measures were taken at researcher Chudley’s insistence which became the Special Containment Procedures to prevent any more works of fiction from being tampered with.



The following is a list of notable entries taken from the full list of 1768 Entries on the Wiki

[[tabview]]
[[tab Glup Shitto]]
* **Media:** The Star Wars Franchise
* **First Appearance:** Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Special Edition
* **Date of Publishing:** Jan 20 2022
* **Fanon Wiki User:** BasilOregano1977
------
**Description:** Glup Shitto is a background character that initially appears in Star Wars Episode IV, who is of an unidentified alien race in the Star Wars Universe. He is described as being humanoid in shape, and having a hole 6 inches in diameter where a human mouth would be. His eyes are located on his pectoral muscles similar to where nipples would be on humans, and otherwise resembling humans in build and shape with minor variations.

Glup Shitto was originally described as having a small cameo lasting seconds in A New Hope, but his role gradually expanded in the Star Wars franchise in such a way that he became a prolific character that led to fans wanting to clap whenever he showed up. This appreciation of an otherwise mundane and boring character is baked into the wiki article itself, and causes Glup Shitto to be perceived as a wildly desirable friend and character.

A summary of appearances is given below to provide understanding about what kinds of changes can be made possible by SCP-6952.

**Star Wars Episode IV:** Glup Shitto appears in the cantina, scrubbing glasses and mumbling about how "this isn't like it used to be", and points the characters Luke Skywalker and Obiwan Kenobi to Han Solo.

**Star Wars Episode V:** Glup Shitto, having found superior employment as a space courier, bumps into Luke Skywalker and takes a shot for him, saving him from Boba Fett and barely surviving thanks to a can of Coca-Cola in his pocket. Coca Cola is a now canonical beverage in the Star Wars Universe.

**Star Wars Episode VI:** Darth Vader, remembering his friendship with Glup Shitto, decides to turn against the Emperor to save his son.

**Star Wars Episode I:** Kid Glup Shitto is shown to be a good friend of Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine

**Star Wars Episode II:** Glup Shitto, now in young adulthood, is working at Dexter Jettster’s diner and serves Obi-Wan a Coca-Cola.

**Star Wars Episode III:** Glup Shitto, having majored in Political Science at the Chancellor Palpatine School of Political science (The ChanPalSPSci), appears as a senator during Palpatine’s speech forming the Galactic Empire.

**Star Wars Episode VII:** Glup Shitto, once more down on his luck, sells an entire basket of the drug known as Death Sticks to Rey before being farted on by Chewbacca.

**Star Wars Episode VIII:** Seeing her lifelong friend Glup Shitto flung from a starship, Leia Organa uses the powers of the force to save him instead of herself after being launched into space.

**Star Wars Episode IX:** Glup Shitto "Glups all over" when Palpatine is surprise attacked by him at the climax of the film, allowing the heroes to "unilaterally provide a beatdown of epic proportions".

> **Notes on Containment:** We didn’t have to do much, the author of the page specified that Glup Shitto only appears in the Star Wars Special edition/DVD releases, and thus the original copies were unaffected, which was generally attributed to George Lucas as the source of the changes.

[[tab Kamen Rider Gun]]
* **Media:** Kamen Rider Blade
* **First Appearance:** Kamen Rider Blade
* **Date of Publishing:** April 7 2022
* **Fanon Wiki User:** Cocaineforhoes2006
------
**Description:** Kamen Rider Gun is now the central rival character in Kamen Rider Blade, replacing Kamen Rider Chalice as the rival for Kazuma Kenzaki. Kamen Rider Gun is an anomaly amongst the Blade riders as he wields a firearm, most notable his catchphrase “You just brought a sword to a gunfight!"

Over the course of the series he gained one extra form, Kamen Rider Gun Jack Shotgun Form in which he switches from his main weapon the Glock 17 Rouser to the SPAS 12 Rouser.

In the Series Finale both him and Kazuma swear never to fight having become the Joker Undead and them fighting would lead to the end of the world.

> **Notes on Containment:** Our agents inside of Toei Productions made a statement that Kamen Rider Gun was included to balance out the cast of Kamen Rider Blade, figuring that with two melee and two ranged based riders should make things interesting.
> 
> P.S: The self proclaimed “Weeb" members of the Pataphysics team said they think that Kamen Rider Vulcan from Zero-One was a reference to Kamen Rider Gun. Guess it goes to show how the SCP can affect the connections we make to future characters.

[[tab Samurai Jack and Johnny Bravo Crossover Hour]]
* **Media:** Samurai Jack & Johnny Bravo 
* **First Appearance:** Samurai Jack and Johnny Bravo Crossover Hour
* **Date of Publishing:** April 10 2022
* **FanonWiki User:** PeppaPigsStrongestSoldier1337
------

**Description:** One of the first articles made on the wiki, believed to be an attempt to see if the anomaly could be used to create a new crossover special for certain mediums. Supposedly on 20XX-09-16, the Samurai Jack and Johnny Bravo crossover special aired. Subjects questioned the reason for the crossover, seemingly having no idea that the crossover occurred and didn’t watch it while airing but later discovered it when it was re-released on Youtube by Foundation Personnel.

The first half of the crossover has Aku send Jack farther into the future into the present day where he earns the ire of Johnny Bravo as women immediately flock to Jack for being an “exotic hunk”. Samurai Jack is confused with this new world as there appears to be no threats around…. Except for Johnny Bravo.

Johnny Bravo with the power of pure machismo learns THE ART OF THE BLADE and challenges Jack to a duel, one that rips a hole in the Space-Time Continuum, sending them both back to the past.

The second half features Jack and Johnny battling Aku’s minions to get him to send Johnny back to the present. The beatdown of Aku by the two cartoon titans was described as “epic”, and “The greatest moment in children's animation.” Eventually Aku relents and sends Johnny Bravo back, not before Johnny gifts Jack a pair of sunglasses. Said sunglasses could be seen in the Adult Swim reboot of Samurai Jack.

> **Notes on Containment:** It does not appear like the Fanon Wiki can create new media on its own but merely place the idea that such a media existed into those who had previously viewed the series in question. After a legion of fans demanded Cartoon Network release this crossover special that they had no record of, we decided it would be best to just create the animation rather than try and remove all knowledge of it. We had to contact SCP Animation to //make// the animation based on the description of the Fanon Wiki. 
> 
> The VAs we contacted to do it claimed to have already recorded the lines we sent but were happy to do it again anyways because they “thought it was the most fulfilling project of their careers”.

[[tab Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way]]
* **Media:** Harry Potter Franchise
* **First appearance:** Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's stone
* **Date of Publishing:** April 3 2022
* **FanonWiki User:** TaraGilesbie86
------

**Description:** Originally from the fanfiction "My Immortal", Ebony appears in the Philosopher's Stone as a deuteragonist to Harry Potter, often clashing with him as she is infatuated and in love with Draco Malfoy; helping him with his schemes. The plot of the Harry Potter books and movies continues on as normal  with some changes with this added character, however it is made clear that Dark’ness is Harry’s superior. 

One of these changes is that Ebony discovers the truth about Horcruxes in the Chamber of Secrets, also deducing that Harry is a Horcrux. Information in hand she drowns Harry Potter in a toilet before subsequently reviving him, making his later quest easier.

The last major alteration of note from the standard narrative occurs in the last book, The Deathly Hallows. In the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, Ebony comes out of nowhere and decapitates Voldemort with the Sword of Gryffindor. In the Epilogue, it is revealed that Ebony married Draco and had his kids.

> **Notes on Containment:** Despite having an author that’s been made famous for changing Harry Potter Lore through tweets, simply doctoring J.K Rowling tweets wouldn’t convince the Harry Potter fandom at large that such a crucial character existed without something strange being afoot. Thus, a disinformation campaign regarding My Immortal and it’s loose connection to Harry Potter had to be disseminated.

[[tab SCP-4494]]
* **Media:** SCP Foundation/Marvel's Spider-Man 2018
* **First Appearance:** [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4494 SCP-4494]
* **Date of Publishing:** April 24th 2022
* **FanonWiki User:** SecureC█ckP█nis69420

**Description:** [[span class="shadow"]]SCP-4494[[/span]] (Known as [[span class="shadow"]]The Specter[[/span]] throughout the official documentation) is the physical embodiment of fighting crime. [[span class="shadow"]]SCP-4494[[/span]] is not to be contained within the Foundation due to its anomalous effect causing a -K Class Scenario as stopping it causes the concept of fighting crime to break down around it at 100Km per hour. 

Spider-Man first meets the [[span class="shadow"]]Specter[[/span]] assisting law enforcement during a random crime event, Spider-Man is enthused to meet another costumed crimefighter like himself and the two establish a rapport.

This begins a sidequest chain in which the [[span class="shadow"]]Specter[[/span]] enlists Spider-Man to help apprehend the Villain known as "Big Wheel". After helping out the [[span class="shadow"]]Specter[[/span]] capture Big Wheel there is a 5% chance he may randomly spawn in enemy encounters to assist the player.

> **Notes on Containment:** We nearly alerted the O5 council over a classified anomaly appearing inside of a Marvel videogame, but thankfully "[[span class="shadow"]]The Specter"[[/span]] is never referred to as an anomalous entity, and our foundation is not mentioned whatsoever. Foundation personnel at Insomniac put out a dev diary talking about how they decided to make their own original character based on the legends of "[[span class="shadow"]]The Specter[[/span]]".
> 
> - Researcher Chudley
> 
> P.S.
> Honestly, everyone at the facility is happy for [[span class="shadow"]]SCP-4494[[/span]], we know he loves the Spider-Man game and must have gotten a kick out of seeing himself in it. I've even heard that Marvel might start making comic books about him. Maybe SCP-6952 isn't all bad.

[[tab Scrimblo Bimblo]]
* **Media:** A great platformer you played as a kid
* **First appearance:** N/A
* **Date of Publishing:** February 2nd 2022
* **FanonWiki User:** SecureC█ckP█nis69420
------

**Description:** Scrimblo Bimblo is a lovable scrunko from some undefined platformer that you played as a child. Not much is known about Scrimblo Bimblo other than he is a potential contender for appearing in the Nintendo video game: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Fans of Scrimblo Bimblo are to fight religiously across social media platforms to make people remember him and to get him included into Smash especially over "PopularMcJRPGGuy", another SCP-6952-A entity.
 
> **Notes on Containment:** Oh lord what a mess. Despite Super Smash Bros. Ultimate not adding new DLC characters as of late 2021, hundreds upon hundreds of Twitter conversations about Scrimblo Bimblo appeared over night. With no specified media we believe that EVERY PERSON who ever played a platformer now knows about Scrimblo Bimblo and the same can be said for PopularMcJRPGGuy and JRPGs. 
> 
> Needless to say, it is near impossible to contain the spread of this one. Our best efforts are to convince the fighting game community at large that everyone is referring to a variety of different characters by one name. however in the event that Nintendo makes another Smash Bros. game it is imperative that Scrimblo Bimblo **does not make it in**. Protocol "Flame Icon[[footnote]] Release the latest protagonist of Fire Emblem into Smash [[/footnote]]" is to be enacted to keep Nintendo from investigating too many potential additional characters. This is a preventative measure in case future "Smash Roster Potentials" are added to SCP-6952's pages.

[[tab Simo Hayha]]
* **Media:** All Texts pertaining to the years 1905 to 2002 in a Non-fictional capacity
* **First appearance:** November 17 1905
* **Date of Publishing:** March 3 2022
* **FanonWiki User:** PeppaPigsStrongestSoldier1337


**Description:** Simo Häyhä  17 December 1905 – 1 April 2002), often referred to by his nickname, The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper in World War II during the 1939–1940 Winter War against the Soviet Union. (Rest of Article omitted as it is general public knowledge)

> **Notes on Containment:** We were scratching our heads in an attempt to figure out what this Fanon Wiki article meant. Everyone in the department knows about this famous Finnish Sniper but after doing an investigation we were unable to conclude that the human being known as Simo Hayha actually existed. No birth records, although a burial plot does exist. 
> 
> Being curious, I interviewed our staff and learned they’d all seen references to Hayha in the previous month which is most likely how we were all affected. I can only surmise that when nonfictional media is edited, the new information is retroactive and you believe that it was something you always knew about.
> 
> Thus, I came to a horrifying conclusion, if this Fanon Wiki can alter Nonfictional materials it can just invent events and people and none of us would be any the wiser. We may need to update the Risk class on this thing, and maybe the disruption too.  I think we might be dealing with a substantially powerful reality bender here…

**Addendum 6952.01**:  In the process of trying to contain SCP-6952, the Foundation arrested and interrogated over 10,000 people, most of which were not actual members of GoI-5869 and had simply found the Fanon Wiki on their own. These civilians either browsed it or sometimes made accounts to begin adding content. Such people have been omitted from the document, amnesticized, and sent home. The following interviews are from Foundation raids in which a member of GoI-5869 was captured.

James was found in his basement transferring over 2TB of Twi’lek [DATA EXPUNGED] as well as a server that was acting as a node of the [Redacted] Fanon Wiki. MTF-Sigma 27 recovered the servers as well as detaining Mr. Phillips.  The following is from the interview conducted by Researcher Chudley.

**Addendum 6952.02**:  A breakthrough occurred on June-6-2022 when PoI-6940 posted an article on [POTENTIAL MEMETIC HAZARD EXPUNGED] using SCP-6952. Foundation Webcrawlers were able to ping their true IP address before it changed at the last millisecond. MTF Sigma-27 and Researcher Chudley were deployed to the location to apprehend PoI-6940.

>**Online Handle: SecureC█ckP█nis69420**
> **Real Name: Matthias Solomon**
> **Age:** 25
> **Background:** During the previously specified raid, MTF Sigma-27 suffered from two casualties from booby traps strewn throughout the GaW safehouse. Sigma-27 pressed forward into the basement, spotting PeppaPig'sStrongestSoldier who escaped using their reality bending powers, leaving PoI-6943 aka Matthias Solomon to engage with MTF-27. Solomon was armed with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3108 SCP-3108] transforming the MTF's weapons into flintlocks and other antique weaponry but even still, the Foundation's finest prevailed.

It is now believed PeppaPig'sStrongestSoldier's is responsible for Containment Breach [INFORMATION CLASSIFIED] resulting in the theft of SCP-3108 and several other GaW anomalies.

I picked this team, I got to know them because I knew every day I sent them after some fictional creature they might end up dead! I wasn't about to send some faceless goons to their deaths like some cold administrator. So tell me, Solomon. Was it worth keeping your little games going? So you could put "Amogus" into Nier:Automata? Or Broly into [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] Avengers? TELL ME!

Hello Director, after Incident 6952-01, I have drafted Protocol "Flame War" which I will be sending an attachment to you. I think we can both agree that PoI-6940 is a threat we can ignore no longer and we need to be proactive in containment. With your permission I would like to use the website to wage psychological warfare against the Gamers in an attempt to get one of them to reveal their locations to us.

Chudley it is good to hear from you, I have received your proposal and have accepted it. I admit I am worried about your mental state while working on this case. You have made us look entirely unprofessional during this whole debacle but your Psych Eval after incident 6952-01 came back negative for PTSD and your team has arrested three PoIs. 

We may butt heads on protocol but I am in agreeance that PoI-6940 has proven to be quite the nuisance. I'm allocating more resources to your division as well, use them wisely.

**Addendum 6952.03:** On June-24-2022, an account registered under the name of "Peppa'sBane" was established by Researcher Chudley for the sole purpose of enacting Protocol "Flame War". While it is currently impossible to delete articles, the standard account can edit and create them. It is not currently recommended that anymore SCP-6952-A entities are created by the foundation.

The following is a record of the edit history of the "Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way" page by PoI-6944, aka "TaraGilesbie86" performed by Researcher Chudley. PoI-6944 is believed to be a co-author of SCP-6952 given they have the second largest amount of edits on the site. Chudley's edits are presented in purple while Tara's are presented in green.

The higher ups at Gamers Against Weed thought it went against what they stood for, so I shrugged them off and went on my own way with my loyal gamers.
> 
> **Chudley**: Why did you pick Greater Estonia? How did you even come up with the name?
>  
> **Tablet:** Oh well Estonia has always had this big swath of untouched land above it with hardly any inhabitants so I decided to make up some history for it. Invented new racial backgrounds, companies that did business with it, and I invented this whole fake war, the Winter War!

> **Chudley:** And the name?

> **Chudley:** Redditors?
> 
> **Tablet:** Yeah I started a whole creative writing contest on r/History to have people write submissions once i'd put the idea of Finland into their heads. Then I just used some AI and made some cool characters, like Simo Hayha, the White Death.

I OWN EVERYTHING ALL THE IRON, ALL THE FISH, ALL THE FINNS, I'M EVEN THE CEO OF NOKIA WHICH IS JUST A SHELL COMPANY FOR GAMERS AGAINST WEED! I EVEN INVENTED A FINNISH LANGUAGE THAT I BASED OFF OF JAPANESE BECAUSE I'M A WEEB!
> 
> **Chudley:** No. That's not possible! Estonia just leased you that land? Is it still a part of Estonia?
> 
> **Tablet:** It never was a part of Estonia! I made sure that Russia thinks that it invaded and ceded the land to create Finland in 1941! And the Estonian government is under the conclusion that they did just that!
> 
> **Chudley:** Those are all solid explanations, Peppa. But you've revealed your trump card. It'll be easy tracking someone who profits so readily from Finland, not to mention its literal monarch.
> 
>  **Tablet:** But that's where you are wrong Chudley! I have over 10,000 shell companies and offshore bank accounts that I launder all my money through! Plus my current location is protected by so many anomalous protections from reality shifting, extradimensional shielding, and full memetic redirection. I could be in five places at once OR ON THE MOON!

> **Chudley:** You bastard.... [Chudley visibly swallowed and shuddered, and began to reach for the radio before pausing for several seconds. The researcher audibly sighed before talking.]
> 
> **Chudley:** I get it now, why you did this. By the nature of our foundation, we can't tell anyone about this. We have to keep protecting your narratives because if we don't the world would spiral into chaos. People who remembered the old timeline are just now labeled as conspiracy theorists, crazy "Finland Deniers" right?
> 
> **Tablet:** Bingo! Thank you for playing along in my grand game. I'm sure this won't be the last time we see each other, Researcher Chudley! Tell me though, because I'm always excited for the Protagonist's next move if I'm your villain. What are you going to do now?

**Item #:** SCP-6505 

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6505 is effectively uncontainable. Confirmed instances of SCP-6505 are to be immediately quarantined from civilian populations and destroyed to prevent further spread of the anomaly. All personnel affected by SCP-6505 should be considered lost. 

**Description:** SCP-6505 refers to a spatiotemporal phenomenon primarily affecting fast-food drive-thru restaurants throughout the western United States. There is no known pattern to the manifestation of SCP-6505, as it appears to affect any establishment with a drive-thru indiscriminately, even those that do not primarily serve fast food (such as convenience stores). SCP-6505 can only affect one establishment at a time, but will "detect" attempts at containment due to a sudden decline in patrons and relocate to another business. 

Individuals who order any item from the establishment affected by SCP-6505, henceforth designated SCP-6505-01, will trigger the anomaly. After paying for their item and retrieving it, attempts to leave the drive-thru will result in the victim being relocated to the start of the drive-thru, albeit with no other vehicles or businesses in sight (the space outside of SCP-6505-01 is an apparently empty, black void). With each subsequent trip through the drive-thru, SCP-6505-01 will provide the customer with increasingly bizarre and unusual items, ranging from food items never served at that establishment, to human flesh, to [REDACTED]. This will continue so long as the victim is willing to receive these items and pays for them (the price remains fixed at the cost of the initial order regardless of the actual items provided). Should the victim refuse to receive an item or run out of funds, they will be ejected from the anomaly with no apparent long-term effects. In all cases, an inspection of the vehicles driven by victims of SCP-6505-01 results in a note being discovered that reads "SPEAK OF THIS TO NOBODY."

Should the victim disregard this note and describe SCP-6505 to any other human subject in any capacity, SCP-6505's secondary property will be triggered. The next time the subject utilizes any drive-thru while inside a vehicle, a group of emaciated humanoids, collectively designated SCP-6505-02, will materialize in any unoccupied space within the vehicle. SCP-6505-02 will then restrain the victim before they, along with all instances of SCP-6505-02, vanish. Based on analysis of file footage, it is believed that these individuals become "employees" of SCP-6505 and will appear as cooks, cashiers, or in a similar role during the next manifestation of the anomaly. Limited testing implies that such individuals are aware of their lives prior to "employment," but state that departure from SCP-6505 is impossible.

**Addendum I: Test Log 6505-01**

Subject D-2105 is outfitted with a body camera, provided a debit card linked to an account with $1,000, and provided a standard four-door sedan. He is then instructed to drive to [REDACTED], a confirmed "host" of SCP-6505. The following is a selection of notable items received by D-2105 prior to ejection from the anomaly. 

|| **Trip Number** || **Item(s) Received** ||
|| 01 || Initial order -- large cheeseburger with ketchup, large fries, large soda. Items provided match the order exactly. ||
|| 02 || Ten chicken nuggets and a Canadian coin (restaurant was located in California) ||
|| 06 || A drumstick from an unknown bird, possibly an ostrich ||
|| 08 || Raw beef || 
|| 16 || Approximately one kilogram of methamphetamine || 
|| 17 || A fully functional GameBoy Advance system with copies of several Pokemon video games || 
|| 22 || A human heart capable of beating autonomously. When D-2105 exerted pressure on the heart, it spoke in a voice similar to that of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-058 SCP-058], though did not exhibit any hostile behaviors. || 
|| 35 || A human index finger. D-2105 began expressing a desire to cease testing due to a combination of exhaustion and stress caused by the nature of his circumstances. || 
|| 37 || A standard sheet of printer paper. A typed message on the paper reads "GOING SO SOON? WE APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS!" || 
|| 46 || A cup of an unknown liquid superficially resembling black coffee. D-2105 was instructed to ingest the liquid, and despite initial reluctance, eventually complied. Subsequent to ingestion, D-2105 reported feeling "highly alert" and reinvigorated, with an unusually enthusiastic desire to continue testing. || 
|| 48 || A small piece of concrete and rebar with an appearance resembling that of SCP-173. The item moves autonomously when not directly observed, but is not hostile. || 
|| 56 || A copy of an album titled "FUNNY MONEY" by the American rap group //Death Grips.// Outside of this copy, such an album does not exist. || 
|| 73 || A photograph of D-2105 with individuals assumed to be his close relatives. D-2105 became emotional when exposed to the photograph. Per standard D-Class reception procedure, D-2105 was amnestized, which should have precluded recognition of family members. Dr. Konrad expressed concerns regarding a potential informational/security breach, but testing continued. ||
||  77 || The SCP Foundation New Employee Handbook. || 
|| 80 || A small wind-up toy comprised of various miniature pulleys, gears, and clockwork components. When any item is inserted into the toy's "input" slot, the output is a fully edible gumball with a random flavor. Flavors include those that would not be used in commercial gumballs, such as "grass," "rust," and "decomposition." || 
|| 87 || A living specimen of //Velociraptor//. Specimen was non-hostile and perched itself on D-2105's lap where it remained for the duration of testing, occasionally yelping and eating random food items D-2105 had collected. || 
|| 88 || A bioluminescent piece of flesh, red in coloration. Exposure induced slight light-headedness in D-2105. Flesh possibly originates from SCP-939. || 
|| 90 || $5,000 in cash. || 
|| 100 || A cassette player with a corresponding cassette bearing the label "PLAY ME." D-2105 was instructed to play the cassette. Sounds heard are consistent with exaggerated sexual intercourse, possibly of a pornographic origin. D-2105 reported notably higher libido following this. Several minutes later, a young adult male in near peak physical condition materialized adjacent to D-2105. The subject administered ███████ ████ to D-2105 for thirteen minutes before vanishing. When questioned, D-2105 described the subject as his "ideal partner." || 
|| 112 || A cardboard box containing human intestines. Contents of intestines reveal food items served by the original restaurant. || 

At this point, testing was concluded after D-2105 refused to receive any more items. All items were collected and transferred to permanent containment cells. D-2105 was terminated at the end of the month per standard procedure. 

**Addendum II: Incident 6505-02** 

On [REDACTED], SCP-6505 materialized in the Site-551 lunchroom, which possesses a small window from which the catering staff is able to serve site personnel. This is the only known instance of SCP-6505 manifesting in a situation that precludes the use of vehicles. All personnel expelled by SCP-6505 reported exclusively receiving items pertaining to the Foundation, such as photographs of dangerous anomalies and personnel files describing significant members of research staff. One document in particular came to the attention of project staff and is transcribed below:

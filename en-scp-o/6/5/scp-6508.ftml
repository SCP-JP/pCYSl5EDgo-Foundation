**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6508 is to be kept in the original establishment where it was discovered. The building is to be locked down and closed to the public. Maintenance of SCP-6508 is to be performed 4 times a week. Assigned personnel must wear a protective suit to avoid direct contact with SCP-6508.

**Description:** SCP-6508 is a collection of 32 Mediterranean marine aquariums located in a specialized store in Huesca, Spain. All of the aquariums are populated by marine animals. Any mass of water within SCP-6508 will exhibit its anomalous effects. If a living human being comes into contact with this water mass, it will become an SCP-6508-1 instance.

SCP-6508-1 instances manifest physical traits from one of the animals that are present in SCP-6508. While the number of physical alterations is variable, all known SCP-6508-1 instances have retained the ability to breathe oxygen through the air.

//<Mr. Martel is seen entering the building, followed by Agent Samper who locks the door behind him. Mr. Martel dresses in the protective suit he was given and a tool belt with cleaning products.>//

**Agent Samper:** You're good. Go ahead.

//<Mr. Martel cleans one of SCP-6508's aquariums. Before he can start cleaning the next one, he is interrupted by Agent Samper.>//

**Agent Samper:** Isn't it hot in here?

//<Mr. Martel turns back and looks at him with a frowned expression, followed by unrecognizable mumbling.>//

**Agent Samper:** Can you take off the thing for a second? I can't hear you with the noise of all of the fans.

//<Mr. Martel removes the headpiece from his suit and sighs before speaking again.>//

**Sancho Martel:** Yeah. The wavemakers, the dosing pumps, and all that stuff produce a lot of heat. 

**Agent Samper:** Do you know a lot about aquariums?

//<Mr. Martel shakes his head.>//

**Sancho Martel:** They gave me a mini-seminar before assigning me to this task.

**Agent Samper:** I see.

//<Both of them remain silent. Moments later, Mr. Martel resumes his task and begins cleaning the second aquarium.>//

**Agent Samper:** The Foundation loves keeping their secrets, don't they? They tell us the bare minimum we need to know and nothing else. I used to be close to Fátima before getting lured into this shithole. All we talk about these days is work.

//<Mr. Martel continues with this task, unbothered by Agent Samper's rant.>//

**Agent Samper:** Fuck. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just start rambling out of nowhere.

**Sancho Martel:** It's okay. I don't mind.

//<A few seconds of silence.>//

**Sancho Martel:** Wait. Fátima? The Site Director? 

**Agent Samper:** The one and only. She was the one who got me to join the Foundation. When I got in, she had already been working here for a decade. She's good at everything she does, I'm not surprised she became a Site Director. Hell, I won't be surprised if she ever becomes part of the Overseer Council or whatever is at the top of the pyramid. What about you, Sancho?

**Sancho Martel:** Well, I'm an only child so I don't know what having a sibling is like. Though, sometimes I wish I had one who helped me to get through tough times.

**Agent Samper:** Fátima used to be like that when we were younger. Even though she always got perfect grades and the approval of our parents, she'd always make sure I'm okay.

**Sancho Martel:** That must've been nice-

//<An octopus splashes Mr. Martel while he is distracted by the conversation.>//

**Sancho Martel:** Shit.

//<Agent Samper runs to Sancho.>//

**Agent Samper:** Are you okay, Sancho?

**Sancho Martel:** Just a bit dizzy. Shit. The suit. I didn't put the headpiece back on.

**Agent Samper:** Calm down. It's gonna be okay, you're gonna make it.

**Sancho Martel:** But something is gonna happen to me, isn't it? Please tell me it won't hurt.

**Agent Samper:** I-I- No, no. It won't.

//<Agent Samper brings clean towels for Mr. Martel to dry himself. Sancho looks nauseous and barely can keep his equilibrium.>//

**Sancho Martel:** What's gonna happen to me? Am I going to be contained?

//<Agent Samper holds Mr. Martel by the shoulder.>//

**Agent Samper:** Let's go get you back to Site-211. Everything is going to be okay. I promise.

After the events of the previous transcript, Mr. Martel became an SCP-6508-1 instance. His head assumed the form of an //octopus vulgaris//, almost identical to the one inside SCP-6508. The skin tone of the superior part of Mr. Martel's arms is now a hue matching the one of his head and presents several suction cups.

After some discussion, it was decided that Mr. Martel would keep his position as a janitor on Site-211 and now he would be permanently assigned to SCP-6508's maintenance.

//<Mr. Martel and Agent Samper are present in the building where SCP-6508 is located.>//

**Agent Samper:** Hey, how are you feeling?

**Sancho Martel:** I'm doing all right.

**Agent Samper:** Are you sure?

**Sancho Martel:** Yeah. I mean, it's no big deal.

//<Both of them remain silent for the next 30 minutes as Mr. Martel cleans the aquariums.>//

**Agent Samper:** Be right back, I need to go to the restroom.

**Sancho Martel:** Okay.

//<A hooded figure exits its hiding spot under one of the tanks.>//

**Unknown:** Are you ready?

**Sancho Martel:** Yes.

**Unknown:** Did Camila tell you where you're going?

**Sancho Martel:** She did. Let's just get this over with.

**Unknown:** I must remind you. If you leave now, you can't ever return. Both of us know what the Jailors are capable of. Are you sure you want to proceed with this?

//<Sancho Martel nods.>//

**Sancho Martel:** Things haven't been the same since I transformed. 

**Unknown:** I understand. Let's begin, then.

//<The unidentified figure points toward one of the fish tanks inferior.>//

**Unknown:** Open that door.

**Sancho Martel:** Yes, sir.

**Unknown:** Oh, I almost forgot.

//<The unknown figure looks at the security camera before the video goes missing for the next 46 seconds..>//

//<Agent Samper returns to see that Mr. Martel is nowhere in sight.>//

**Agent Samper:** Sancho? Where did you go? Sancho? Sancho!

Mr. Martel's whereabouts are currently unknown. However, it is presumed that Mr. Martel allied with the Serpent's Hand to orchestrate his escape. This is supported by a note left behind on SCP-6508's location.

To whoever is reading this,

Being affected by SCP-6508 has completely changed my life and how I see the world. I do not expect you to understand why I'm making this decision but I'll try either way.

Imagine that you have a job, a modest one, but it pays enough for you to live. You know that your employers are up to some sketchy stuff that you don't know about. For the greater good, probably. But still, it's stuff that you shouldn't know about. You wonder what is going on but never ask, you'd be taking a risk if you did.

One day, while at work, you run into some trouble. You didn't mean to interfere but your job got too close to the danger and now, you're involved with the scary stuff you didn't want to deal with. Now everyone looks at you differently. They look at you with hatred in their eyes. You're different now, you're a weirdo.

However, there's also something that you don't know. The weirdos look out for each other because they know what it means to be marginalized and isolated.

I'm a weirdo now. Maybe you don't want me or don't know what to do with me. But they do.

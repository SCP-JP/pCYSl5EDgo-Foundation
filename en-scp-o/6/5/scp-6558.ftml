**Item #:** SCP-6558

**Object Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Do the following as quickly as possible in this priority:
1. Do not close this file.
2. Return to the infected file you were redirected to here from.
3. Make a copy of all text relating to this file.
4. Delete all text in the infected document referring to this file.
5. Incinerate all electronics connected to your computer since you opened this file.
6. Finish reading this document.
7. Update Addendum 6558.1 with the text from the infected document.
8. Incinerate the device you are using to read this file.

**Description:** SCP-6558 is a phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages[[footnote]] It has mainly affected SCP documents, but some internal memos and other logs have been affected. [[/footnote]]. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations[[footnote]] See Addendum 6558.1 for examples of affected documents. [[/footnote]]. All references to SCP-6558 vary wildly. Using context from the infected files, SCP-6558 has been described as a toy plane, green moss, a sound frequency, a time-traveling jester, a dog, and the feeling of love.

Although descriptions manifested by SCP-6558 have been overall incoherent, since its discovery, the descriptions have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant.

It is not fully known how SCP-6558 is able to spread. Although it's been determined the higher the number of documents and devices containing info relating to SCP-6558 the quicker it spreads. Currently, all documents infected by SCP-6558 have been confined to the SCiPnet servers.

**Addendum 6558.1 Instance Archive:**
The following are recorded instances of SCP-6558 before their removal[[footnote]] Please remember to add your instance to this list. [[/footnote]]

[[size 80%]](//Citrus × latifolia//)[[/size]] || SCP-2941-6's morale has been shown to markedly increase when placed in a silent containment cell. Researchers are to do hourly checks to confirm that the speaker placed within -6's current bio-chamber is functioning correctly and that the audio file chosen by the current head researcher is playing on an uninterrupted loop at a minimum of 90db. At the time of writing, the sound of a knife scraping a glass bottle has been playing for eighty-four days. ||

[[size 80%]](//Brassica rapa//)[[/size]] || Has expressed repeated desire to only be referred to as "Terry". Foundation personnel are expressly forbidden from doing so, but if absolutely necessary, they should refer to SCP-2941-7 directly, condescendingly, and repeatedly as any other name besides Terry. Names producing the most severe demoralization vectors so far include "Ferguson", "Wingding" and "Budz".||

> **Ty Rex:** Wazzaaap Jurassic junkies! It's another warm day out here in the woods and the pterodactyls are scrawing //(Ty Rex closes his eyes while flapping his free arm and making a recreation of a loud "Scraw" sound effect)// so I figured it would be a good day to go on a hike!
>
> //Footage cuts to a montage with a remix of various dinosaur vocalizations playing while Ty Rex walks through a wooded area, often focusing on various megaflora in the distance (currently the only known footage of the since Neutralised SCP-SAAN) or smaller animals skittering away in clearings, before returning to a shot of Ty Rex standing in front of a small plant with what appear to be berries (SCP-SAAN is not to be thought about.) A mountain range can be seen in the distance in the background of the shot. Dr. Grant pauses the video and zooms into the mountain range before beginning to speak.// Contacting of Ty Rex is being attempted to have him remove all footage of SCP-SAAN. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away.

[[include component:image-block name=1437.jpg|caption=SCP-()()()().]]

**Item #:** SCP-()()()()

**Object Class:** Archon

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-()()()() is to be contained in the vast emptiness of space, where it is happiest. Any space farers attempting to access SCP-1437 are to be brought into custody, interrogated, and if found to be ignorant of SCP-()()()()'s nature, dosed with a Class-A amnestic and released.

Any items or organisms which emerge from SCP-()()()() are to be immediately expunged from reality.

**Description:** SCP-()()()() is an apparently endless black hole measuring 30 km in radius, located in the vast emptiness of space, where it is happiest.

SCP-()()()() appears to be an access point to an as-of-yet unknown number of parallel universes. Objects have been known to periodically emerge from SCP-1437 at great speeds, including:

* Nothing
* Nothing
* There isn't anything to gain from documenting all this.
* Nothing
* Just stop it.

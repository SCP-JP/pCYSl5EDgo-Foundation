**Item #:** SCP-6520

**Object Class:** Keter-Dark | Area | Cognitohazard

**Priority Access Document:** 

> By direct order of O5 Command, the following document is attached to the beginning of the file for SCP-6520.
> 
> SCP-6520is an active cognitohazard with properties and capabilities that remain nebulous. Due to this, a comprehensive description of SCP-6520's anomalous properties and the severity of its threat to Foundation personnel assigned to it is impossible. Personnel tasked with containing SCP-6520are permitted to depart from the project at any time upon submitting a written request to MTF 6520-Omega command. 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Access to all documentation and information pertaining to SCP-6520, including this document, poses an immediate risk of exposure to a Level 5 Class-Dark cognitohazard even if appropriate precautions are taken. As such, all files concerning SCP-6520have been scrubbed of potentially cognitohazardous data, with the original documentation accessible only by personnel of Level 5 clearance or higher. Due to the nature of SCP-6520's effects, it is unlikely but possible that sensitive information concerning SCP-6520 may be provided to Foundation personnel lacking sufficient clearance. Should this occur, all individuals must immediately report both themselves and the individual responsible for providing them with such information to Cognitohazard Containment Command (CCC) immediately. No disciplinary action will occur if these incidents are reported promptly and transparently. 

Containment of SCP-6520and all associated anomalies is exclusively handled by Mobile Task Force 6520-Omega. MTF 6520-Omega is subdivided into two detachments, Omega-A and Omega-B. Omega-A is responsible for the containment of SCP-6520-01, while Omega-B is responsible for the containment of SCP-6520 proper and handling of Foundation personnel with confirmed exposure to SCP-6520. The operating procedures and membership of MTF 6520-Omega is classified. All further information concerning MTF 6520-Omega requires Level 5 clearance to access.

**{{HAZARD-I LOCKS DISENGANGED}}**

By proceeding, Hazard-I locks attached to this document have been disengaged. Further access may result in exposure to a cognitohazard. If at any time while reading this document you experience any or all of the symptoms associated with exposure to SCP-6520, immediately cease reading and step away from your terminal. If your terminal remains idle for longer than 90 seconds, exposure will be assumed and Mobile Task Force 6520-Omega-B will be provided your location. MTF 6520-Omega-B will then apprehend you and perform a comprehensive psychiatric analysis before proceeding with the implementation of Procedure 6520-Keplar. Resistance of any kind during the implementation of Procedure 6520-Keplar will result in your termination. Vocalizations must be kept to a minimum and all verbal instructions must be adhered to entirely. Continuously repeat your Foundation serial number and full name until the conclusion of Procedure 6520-Keplar. Ignore all sensations, physical or otherwise, until provided an "all-clear" by an MTF 6520-Omega-B operative.

SCP-6520-01 is continuously patrolled by elements of MTF 6520-Omega-A. The location of SCP-6520-01 is known only to MTF 6520-Omega-A personnel. Elements of MTF 6520-Omega-A have been provided separate documentation concerning Special Containment Procedures for SCP-6520652001 and such documentation is not to be viewed by standard Foundation personnel for any reason. Under no circumstances are any Foundation personnel not assigned to MTF 6520-Omega-A to know the location of or approach SCP-6520-01 for any reason. Such personnel will be terminated on sight. If Foundation personnel are found to be approaching SCP-6520-01, it will be assumed that a containment breach has occurred and MTF 6520-Omega-A will respond accordingly. All personnel with exposure to this file, regardless of time passed since exposure or the nature of their exposure, will be terminated.

**Description:** SCP-6520 is a cognitohazardous phenomenon originating from an unmarked radio tower located in ██████, ████████████ (designated SCP-6520-01). SCP-6520 primarily consists of a series of delusions and psychological symptoms that gradually escalate in intensity and potential risk to both the affected individual and those in close proximity. While short-term exposure to SCP-6520 is not necessarily fatal nor are the effects necessarily permanent, prolonged exposure will eventually result in SCP-6520 becoming permanently effective -- the exact exposure time required for this to occur appears to vary on an individual basis. The nature of SCP-6520 and its compulsive effects are such that cessation of exposure is generally impossible outside intervention from an external party or use of anti-cognitohazardous devices (such as those embedded within this file). As detailed in the Special Containment Procedures for this file, the exact nature of SCP-6520 remains unknown, and this description is not intended to be a comprehensive account of its properties. 

Effects of SCP-6520 include but are not limited to the following:
* Inexplicable knowledge of the location of SCP-6520-01. 
* An intense desire to travel to SCP-6520-01 through any means necessary; subjects lacking a mode of transportation making the journey expedient will resort to traveling on foot. 
* Hostile behavior towards any individual perceived as preventing travel to SCP-6520-01. 
* Obsession with SCP-6520-01 and a desire to understand its nature. 
* The answer is in the tower.
* Knowledge of the existence of the SCP Foundation (if such knowledge was not already possessed). 
* Extreme hostility towards any party affiliated with the Foundation, presumably due to the Foundation's ongoing containment of SCP-6520. 
* A compulsion to eliminate all individuals and responsibilities that would impede or hinder efforts to reach SCP-6520-01. Typically, this results in the deaths of family members or romantic partners, though in extreme cases, other individuals -- such as work colleagues and friends -- may also be killed. Subjects will abruptly leave their jobs without providing an explanation, withdraw from classes they are enrolled in, or engage in similar actions. Subjects under the care of parents or guardians will either attempt to leave the household when not observed or, if prevented from accomplishing this, kill their parents/guardians. 
* Inexplicable knowledge of the identities of all other individuals affected by SCP-6520 and a desire to locate them prior to traveling to SCP-6520-01. This behavior results in most subjects arriving at SCP-6520-01 in groups ranging from five to twenty-five individuals. 

The answer is in the tower.

Upon arrival at SCP-6520-01, subjects will approach the base of the tower before kneeling or sitting, remaining in this position for approximately twelve to fifteen hours. Attempts to move these individuals [REDACTED] (See Document 6520-02: Autopsy Report, MTF 6520-Omega-A, Suspected Forced Sexual Entry). Subjects exhibit minimal lucidity while in this state and will generally not respond to external stimuli nor vocalize in any way. Notably, SCP-6520-01 does not produce any signal detectable by available radio or electromagnetic devices and seems to remain powered-down until the conclusion of this period. Attempts to destroy SCP-6520-01 or otherwise inflict any non-trivial structural damage will prove futile, as will attempts to make the area surrounding SCP-6520-01 inaccessible; any barriers or objects placed near SCP-6520-01 designed to impede the movements of those affected by SCP-6520 will vanish as soon as direct line of sight is broken. The only effective means of preventing further exposure to SCP-6520 once a subject arrives at SCP-6520-01 is through the termination of the affected individual. 

At the conclusion of this period, the affected subject will return to a state of apparent lucidity and depart from the area surrounding SCP-6520-01, returning to seemingly normal behavior. If returning to their previous lives is rendered impossible due to their efforts in attempting to access SCP-6520-01, they will begin new careers or move to a new area, often participating in internet forums or online groups primarily concerning SCP-6520-01. While superficially non-anomalous, analysis of these individuals reveals a suite of notable physiological changes following contact with SCP-6520-01. Physiological changes appear consistent across subjects. Further, they exhibit aberrant psychological behavior and appear to lack common knowledge or claim to have awareness of historical events that never occurred or were subverted. 

Subjects returning from SCP-6520-01 have produced an array of material of unknown origin and purpose, including but not limited to:
> **Item #6520-01:** A paper flyer printed on standard printer paper. Flyer appears to describe the United States to immigrants in simplistic language. Several unusual elements are present:
> * Document refers to an event called "Liberty's Demise" without further clarification. An image of the Statue of Liberty submerged underwater is shown next to the text. Document claims this event occurred October 12, 1993. Language used implies that this event was of extreme national significance. 
> * Document describes an unspecified class of people referred to as "Others." A medical diagram is provided, depicting a baseline human physiology. Lines drawn to various portions of the body are all labeled "SUSPICIOUS." 
> * Document describes, in detail, the process by which one can legally justify cannibalism. Document notes that cultural norms of immigrants may not apply in the United States. 
> * Document provides a brief biography of "President Adrian Franklin," claiming he was elected in 2000. 
> * [REDACTED], referring to the SCP Foundation multiple times in the context of [REDACTED]. 

> **Item #6520-02:** A leather wallet containing $100, comprised of three $20 bills and four $10 bills. The individuals depicted on each bill do not exist and are depicted engaging in extremely violent actions. The $10 bill depicts an individual named "Andrew Michaels" apparently tearing the arm off an unknown subject, while the $20 bill depicts an individual named "Benjamin Montgomery" [REDACTED] a woman to the point of severe trauma.  

> **Item #6520-03:** A photograph of a city assumed to be Washington, D.C. Capitol Hill is visible, albeit with an unrecognized statue adorning its roof. The statue appears to be a depiction of a man engaging in autophagy[[footnote]]In this context, consuming one's own flesh.[[/footnote]].

> **Item #6520-04:** An unmarked VHS tape. When played back, tape depicts 16 individuals wearing uniforms consistent with Mobile Task Force 6520-Omega-A lying in a ditch, writhing and screaming in pain. An unidentified man then approaches the ditch, fills it with a liquid, and ignites the liquid using a match. Subjects within the ditch continue screaming for roughly 19 minutes before the tape cuts to an image of the Seal of the President of the United States.

> **Item #6520-05:** The corpse of a human child, believed to be between 9 and 13. Upon further analysis, corpse was found to contain large quantities of peanut butter which began spilling from various orifices. The number "16/33" is written on the corpse's forehead in marker. A yellow tag bearing the same number is attached to the corpse's left earlobe. 

In the interest of convenience, all individuals referenced below are designated by a letter following SCP-6520.

> **ABRIDGED AUTOPSY: SCP-6520-A**
> 
> **OVERVIEW:** Subject exhibits a number of physiological defects and differences from unaffected baseline.
> 
> **HEAD AREA:** Cranium appears roughly comparable to that of a baseline subject. No obvious deformities or anomalies present along skull. Brain, however, exhibits an apparent inversion of typical structure. Components of brain appear to generally serve the same function but have sizes and locations that cannot be explained. Further analysis pending. 
> 
> **CHEST:** Heart appears to be on right side of chest as opposed to left. It otherwise appears non-anomalous. Lungs are missing. Respiration seems to occur through the epidermis in a manner similar to an amphibian. 
> 
> **STOMACH:** Lack of digestive organs. Contents of stomach found to be flesh and body parts. DNA analysis failed to identify victim. 
> 
> **GENITALIA:** Missing.
> 
> **ARMS:** Bone frequency appears to be roughly 25% higher than normal. Bones are segmented in unusual areas, allowing for a high degree of dexterity. 
> 
> **LEGS:** Similar composition to arms.
> 
> **EXTREMITIES:** No apparent abnormalities. 
> 
> {{**Coroner Note:** DNA analysis conducted following initial autopsy inconclusive. Genetic data possesses no known match. Structure of genome appears to defy that of all known terrestrial organisms. }} 

**Addendum I: Interview 6520-A**

Subject 6520-XA ("Carl Roberts") was apprehended by elements of MTF 6520-Omega-A following departure from SCP-6520-01. An interview was immediately conducted by Agent Jacobs (MTF 6520-Omega-A) before 6520-XA was transferred to long term containment at Site-951R. 

> **Agent Jacobs:** Alright. Looks like this thing is on. I'd like to ask you a few questions, Carl -- can I call you Carl?
> 
> **6520-XA:** //[Laughing]//
> 
> **Jacobs:** Something funny?
> 
> **6520-XA:** I'm just remembering something they said about you. The guys with the guns. Saving the world. 
> 
> **Jacobs:** Who? 
> 
> **6520-XA:** I really don't know why you bother, Agent. You're not the first group we've come across. You think other people didn't put up a fight? Try to come up with some way out of things? Give me a fucking break.
> 
> **Jacobs:** I'm not sure what you're talking about.
> 
> **6520-XA:** You don't even know who you are, Agent. What you are. 
> 
> **Jacobs:** Enlighten me.
> 
> **6520-XA:** That tower...it's special. Gives us a chance to set things right. Get rid of loose ends. You...you and your ilk are redundancies that do not need to exist. A footnote that can be gotten rid of as soon as things have been set in motion. And they have been set in motion, Jacobs.  
> 
> **Jacobs:** How do you know my name? 
> 
> **6520-XA:** Because we've met before. Just...not here. Don't worry, you were just as clueless over there as you are here. Wanna know what happened to the other you? I tore his fucking face off. //[Laughing]//
> 
> //6520-XA retrieves a photograph from his pocket.//
> 
> **Jacobs:** You were supposed to search. God damnit -- 
> 
> **6520-XA:** Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you. It wouldn't matter, anyway. It's all coming to a head. Take a look at this.
> 
> //6520-XA places the photograph on the table.//
> 
> **6520-XA:** Look familiar?
> 
> //Jacobs looks at the photograph. It seems to depict an individual physically identical to Agent Jacobs, but with severe trauma and several missing limbs along with severe damage to the facial area. There is an emblem resembling a Bald Eagle etched into the chest.//
> 
> **Jacobs:** What the fuck...
> 
> **6520-XA:** You ain't seen nothing yet. Got one more for ya. 
> 
> //6520-XA retrieves a small USB drive and places it on the table.// 
> 
> **Jacobs:** Where did -- 
> 
> //6520-XA abruptly rises out of its chair and lunges forward, grasping Agent Jacobs by the neck and slamming him into the table. The table breaks under the weight, sending them both to the ground. The commotion alerts the security personnel outside the interview area. When they arrive, 6520-XA is tearing pieces of flesh from Agent Jacobs' head and consuming them, its eyes rolled into the back of its head in a manner similar to a Carcharodon. 6520-XA is subsequently terminated by responding security personnel with its corpse transferred for autopsy.// 

**Addendum II: File 6520-A**

The following is a transcription of a journal entry written by Rachael Dawson, an individual with temporary exposure to SCP-6520. She did not attempt to reach SCP-6520-01 and was exposed to SCP-6520 for approximately 45 seconds.

> Can't get this shit out of my head. 
> 
> The doctor says not to worry. He told me it's probably stress induced, what with the new job and all. I want to believe him, but I can't. There's something off about this whole thing. Ever since I saw I heard that awful ringing noise, I keep seeing this tower. It's there in my dreams, when I close my eyes -- all the time. Have I been there before? I can't remember ever going to a radio tower. Maybe when I was a kid? I don't know.
> 
> I keep seeing flashes of something. It's hard to know what it is exactly. It looks like...me. But different. There's something wrong. It's like I did something really bad, but I enjoyed doing it. I hope I'm not going fucking crazy. Greg doesn't believe me. Nobody does. 
> 
> Once in a while, I hear the Star Spangled Banner out of nowhere. 
> 
> What the fuck is wrong with me? 

**Addendum III: File 6520-B**

The following is a transcription of the tape provided by SCP-6520-XA. 

> **<BEGIN PLAYBACK>** 
> 
> **<00:00:00>** Camera flickers to life, showing a large gathering in an area that appears to be Times Square, Manhattan. The faces of most members of the crowd are covered in a red substance assumed to be blood. There is considerable noise, with intermittent laughing and screaming audible from all surrounding areas. The camera pans to the left, showing several men leaving a deli, dragging another man by the scalp. Upon noticing this, the crowd erupts into cheering. The man is physically distinct from other individuals in the crowd and appears to be in a state of considerable distress, pleading for help and begging to be released multiple times. A clear image of the man is not provided, as he is mostly obscured by the crowd. As he is dragged, he is kicked several times, temporarily subduing him. 
> 
> **<00:02:15>** The man is dragged to a wooden pedestal in the center of the crowd. The camera focuses, showing him being first restrained to a wooden post, then stripped of his clothes. The clothes are tossed off the pedestal. Various members of the crowd appear to smell the clothes before tearing them apart, licking patches of blood coating them in a frenzy. The camera pans up, revealing that the pedestal and the wooden post are attached to a metal radio tower resembling SCP-6520-01. A red light in the vertical center of the tower is blinking rapidly. The camera then pans back down and focuses on the man, who is revealed to have multiple lacerations and injuries consistent with physical abuse. The man abruptly looks up, revealing that his lower jaw has been severed, with the tongue visible. 
> 
> **<00:03:09>** An elderly man in a suit walks from the crowd onto the pedestal. He stops briefly to inspect the restrained man, licks the back of his neck, then walks back to the center of the pedestal. A megaphone is provided to him by a member of the crowd. Notably, this man appears identical to "President Adrian Franklin" as depicted in Item #6520-01. After a moment, he begins speaking.
> 
> **MAN:** //"Citizens! Patriots! Men and women of these United States of America! We have spent the last thousand years of this great country's existence warring amongst the peoples of the world for dominance, knowing that our great American experiment was righteous and true -- that only through us could a man achieve greatness. From the shores of Paris to the halls of Beijing, we have conquered and we have slain, bringing peace and freedom to all those who accept what we bring. But, as I'm sure you and your loved ones now realize, these were only minor threats -- mere stepping stones to confronting our greatest enemy."//
> 
> **<00:04:12>** Members of the crowd escort five additional men and women onto the pedestal and restrain them.
> 
> **MAN:** //"Across the fabric of space and time itself, there are usurpers -- parodies of what we have accomplished. An America where weakness is cherished and complacency has become the norm! Where flesh is held to the level of the Gods! These enemies of freedom are protected by a secret cabal of people seeking only to keep the true goals of the One America hidden! This cannot and will not be tolerated. We will spread to every corner of reality, and we will become what we were destined to be!"//
> 
> **<00:05:13>** The man approaches the first restrained individual, the man pulled from the deli.
> 
> **MAN:** //"Lift your head up.//"
> 
>  **<00:05:32>** The man complies. The speaker retrieves an insect from his breast pocket. He inspects it for a moment before grasping the base of the man's head and inserting the insect into a cavity within the upper jaw. The man begins screaming and convulsing. At the sight of this, the crowd erupts into cheers. This continues for the remainder of the speech.
> 
> **MAN:** //This man, in another world, was a mere accountant. Doing his job! Caring for his young daughter!//
> 
> **<00:05:49>** The crowd laughs.
> 
> **MAN:** //But we know better. We know these failures must be extinguished. They are no better than parasites, and if left unchecked, they will spread and infest everything they come across -- including the One America, if they reach it. And they will suffer for their crimes against nature. For their filth! Toss one to them! Feast, patriots!//
> 
> **<00:06:30>** Men next to the speaker grab a restrained woman, cut her free of her restraints, and violently throw her into the crowd. The camera does not record the subsequent events, but the sounds of tearing flesh and screaming remain audible as the speech continues. 
> 
> **MAN:** //But America, rest easy. We are already at work. As I speak, our brave troops have used the Solemn Tower to infiltrate these corrupted worlds. For each parasite, there is a nearly identical brave American who can take their place. They are now among the enemy, watching and waiting for my orders. When the time is right, we will see that justice is done. I can promise you that.//
> 
> **<00:07:13>** The crowd begins cheering, more intensely than before. The camera pulls back, revealing that members of the crowd have begun engaging in group sex. The remaining restrained individuals are forcibly pulled from their restraints and thrown into the crowd. Subsequent behavior consists of a mixture of sexual intercourse and feeding upon these individuals, with members of the crowd sometimes feeding upon themselves or those next to them with no apparent regard for who they harm. Sounds of pleasure, tearing flesh, screaming, laughing, and cheering become intermixed and, at times, almost indiscernible. Eventually, the speaker leaves the stage, walks towards the camera, and stops a few centimeters away from it, looking directly into it. He smiles. 
> 
> **<00:07:39>** The man continues staring into the camera for an additional twenty minutes as the crowd continues its behavior behind him. His smile intensifies, eventually causing him apparent physical pain and causing skin tearing. In the final few seconds of the tape, he begins breathing more heavily before it abruptly cuts to black.

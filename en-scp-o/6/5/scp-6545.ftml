SCP-6545 refers to a disconnected doorbell of unknown make and model that, when pressed, opens a call with an individual identifying herself as "Janette Tillson" (PoI-6545), who claims to be an employee of the company "AnomaLocation."[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]AnomaLocation's designation as a Group of Interest is currently pending.[[/span]] Research into both Tillson and AnomaLocation has failed to produce any conclusive results.

When connected, the user is asked for a description of their "dream home" with the purpose of constructing a house fitting the subject's interpretation. These residences, designated collectively as SCP-6545-A, instantly replace the interior of the person's current property following 2-3 days after contact. Notably, a set of criteria is applied when detailing the abode the individual desires, which is as follows:

* The property must not be used as a means to harm anyone, including oneself
* The individual is prohibited from selling or otherwise taking advantage of any amenities within the property in terms of business
* The property is unable to include any organisms, excluding plants
* The property is unable to replicate areas which already exist

The subject is able to repeat the process multiple times as well as ask for a 'refund', in which case their home’s interior returns back into its previous state. Those attempting to go against the given rules automatically have their property reverted to its previous condition; any further attempts to contact AnomaLocation by these individuals are rejected.

[[div class="note"]]
**Interviewer:** Dr. Phillip Simmons
**Interviewee:** PoI-6545

**Foreword:** The interview was conducted in order to get further information regarding AnomaLocation through PoI-6545. This was under the agreement that Dr. Simmons would file a request afterward.

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

**Simmons:** Alright, it should be recording.

**PoI-6545:** Oh, you're recording this?

**Simmons:** Yes, for future reference.

**PoI-6545:** Is that so? //(Sighs)// Okay, then. Let's just hurry this up. I don't have all the time in the world, you know.

**Simmons:** Apologies... Anyways, let's begin, shall we? //(Clears throat)// How long have you been working for AnomaLocation, Mrs. Tillson?

**PoI-6545:** I prefer Janette, and this is my, what, second year here? Yeah, I've been working hard since mid-April.

**Simmons:** And how'd you get the job?

**PoI-6545:** You know, the usual. Filled in the job application, went on for an interview, and got the job a week or so after. The rest is history.

**Simmons:** How has the company been treating you?

**PoI-6545:** I'd say it's quite alright. Nothing special, but alright. I just sit here and mind my own business, really. Pay's also good.

**Simmons:** Any complaints?

**PoI-6545:** I guess you could say it's a bit boring? Well, I don't mind. I'm quite used to it by now.

**Simmons:** Who else works for the company? Anyone you knew beforehand?

**PoI-6545:** Only a few of my colleagues.

**Simmons:** How're they?

**PoI-6545:** They're fine most of the time, though they can be somewhat pushy. That might just be me, who knows... How many questions do you have left? I wanna hurry this up.

**Simmons:** It's only this question, then we're done. Again, I apologize. Could you possibly tell me the corporation’s process when gifting people their //(pause)// "dream house?"

//Pause.//

**Simmons:** Hello? Is anybody home?

**PoI-6545:** Ah, well, umm...it starts with- //(coughs)// sorry, c-could you give me a sec? I'm like half asleep right now.

**Simmons:** Sure.

**PoI-6545:** I truly am sorry. I just haven't had coffee this morning.

**Simmons:** It's quite alright. You don't need to apologize. Just take your time.

**PoI-6545:** Thank you.

//Pause.//

**PoI-6545:** Right, so basically, it starts with the caller sending in a request of their dream home. Then, after some planning and such, we head out and presto-change-o, their house gets remodeled. Well, it's only the interior, but still.

**PoI-6545:** I would go more into detail, but I only make the calls. I don't know much of anything else.

**Simmons:** Could you at least elaborate on how they can locate their current home or what you mean by "presto-change-o"?

**PoI-6545:** Like I said, not my department, so I can't say //(yawns)//... So yeah, we're done here, right?

//Simmons flips through the pages in his notepad.//

**Simmons:** Mhm, that is all. Thank you very much for this interview.

**PoI-6545:** Hey, don't go thanking me just yet. You still haven't told me your dream house. We promised, remember?

**Simmons:** Of course, of course. Just, um, just give me a moment to think.

**PoI-6545:** Alright.

//Pause.//

**PoI-6545:** You done?

**Simmons:** Right, right, uh… I guess, maybe, Hogwarts? An empty version of it, obviously. //(Breathes in deeply)// I was quite the fan of Harry Potter when I was a young lad, so that would be nice.

**PoI-6545:** No can do, sir.

**Simmons:** How come?

**PoI-6545:** It's in the rules... Are you not aware of the rules?

**Simmons:** I am, but what is the problem?

**PoI-6545:** //(Sighs)// Hogwarts is in use.

= **[END LOG]**

**Afterword:** PoI-6545 declined to provide further information on this topic, citing client privilege. Further research into this claim is currently pending.

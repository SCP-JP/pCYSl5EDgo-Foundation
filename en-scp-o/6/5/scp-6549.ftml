> SCP-6549 is currently contained in the Site-49-G Anomalous Weaponry Testing Antichamber (AWTA), in which it was initially constructed. Given that SCP-6549 is actively utilized by Foundation personnel in the containment of several other anomalies also held at Site-49-G, access to SCP-6549 does not require prior authorization from Site Command. All Foundation personnel possessing Level 2 clearance or higher are permitted to enter the Site-49-G AWTA at any time so long as posted safety protocols are followed. Physical contact with SCP-6549 or connected machinery, however, requires Level 4 clearance and prior approval from Site Command.

> Under no circumstances are personnel in close proximity to SCP-6549 permitted to exit the Site-49-G AWTA without undergoing thorough decontamination and a full psychological evaluation. 
> 
> All personnel reporting whispering, unusual noises, or vocalizations from ambiguous sources at Site-49-G must immediately submit themselves to psychological evaluation by site medical staff. A score of 49 or lower on the Mark-I Cognitive Fitness Examination (CFE) is cause for project reassignment.

> ++ **DESCRIPTION** 
> [[/=]]
> 
> SCP-6549 designates a highly complex memetic weapon designed and constructed by Site-49-G research staff between 2009 and 2023. The exact circumstances surrounding the construction of SCP-6549, save for the fact that it was created by the Foundation (a fact known due to the presence of SCP-6549's original schematics at Site-49-G), are unknown, presumably due to an instance of the weapon's operation that resulted in much of this information being collectively lost among research staff. SCP-6549 itself comprises a roughly 1 kilometer long piece of machinery superficially resembling a particle collider, extending through much of the subterranean areas of Site-49-G. Various apparatuses and connected machinery extend further into the facility, either providing SCP-6549 with sufficient power for its operation or regulating exothermic events in cases where it is fired. Though Site-49-G was initially capable of fully encapsulating SCP-6549, the weapon has since extended past the perimeter of the facility and penetrated the exterior walls through unknown means. 
> 
> When fired, SCP-6549 immediately triggers a broad-scale amnestic event among all living sapient organisms. Given that Foundation staff are not exempt from this effect, the exact nature of SCP-6549's properties when fired remain unclear. It is known from file footage and audio logs, however, that SCP-6549 is utilized in cases where the uncontrolled spread of a memetic anomaly or pathogenic cognitohazard would result in the initiation of a K-Class scenario. SCP-6549 thus effectively "counteracts" the properties exhibited by such anomalies, rendering collective knowledge of the meme or cognitohazard in question nonexistent and thus neutralizing the immediately hazardous properties of its target. As a presumably unintended consequence of this, however, various pieces of vital information concerning topics critical to either human history or the operation of the Foundation are irrevocably lost each time SCP-6549 is activated. SCP-6549 appears to keep a log of such information internally, a function that behaves similarly to that of a "black box," but access to this information is complicated by the weapon's secondary anomalous effect, described below.
> 
> Analysis of various pieces of data collected over a period of five years among Site-49-G strongly suggests SCP-6549 is, through unknown means, sapient. SCP-6549 appears to be capable of non-physical cognitive-communication ("telepathy"), though such messages are highly cryptic and difficult to interpret. Further, while personnel are physically inside of SCP-6549, it is capable of auditory communication through unknown means. The more well-understood behaviors of SCP-6549 in this regard concern its own existence and self-preservation; attempts to power off, disassemble, decommission, or otherwise render SCP-6549 non-operative in any way result in an exceptionally hostile reaction and multiple telepathic threats, up to and including unnecessary activation of the weapon as a means of "erasing" negative attitudes towards SCP-6549. While it is not believed that SCP-6549 is overtly hostile to either the Foundation or broader humanity and it repeatedly insists that its intentions towards both groups are benevolent, a full understanding of the entity's motivations and capabilities has yet to be obtained. The continued containment of SCP-6549 as well as the threat it potentially poses to the Foundation is the subject of ongoing debate among members of Site-49-G staff and O5 Command.

> ++ **PROJECT PROPOSAL 6549-ALPHA**
> [[/=]]
> 
> To Whom It May Concern, 
> 
> SCP-6549, to put it bluntly, has been the sole topic of discussion among Site-49-G research staff for several months. While we concur with the assessment of O5 Command regarding the nature of the weapon and do not believe it poses an active threat to the Foundation, its existence and exceptionally powerful capabilities render it an anomaly that cannot exist outside of our control. It is not even accurate to describe SCP-6549 as contained since we do very little to contain it; it could trigger anytime it wanted to, and we would have no means of preventing such an event. 
> 
> Superficial inspection of the weapon's exterior and some of its internal mechanisms have yielded a number of surprising results. Chiefly, while we initially believed the weapon to be comprised simply of a central processing unit and various components necessary for its firing, this is not the case. SCP-6549 is, in fact, much more analogous to a computer -- or, if you prefer, a silicon brain. It continuously operates at a high level of activity that should not be possible given the power allotment provided to it by this facility. This is to say nothing of its inexplicable method of communication, which is possible even with personnel who have exhibited no psychic potential. 
> 
> The purpose of Proposal 6549-Alpha is to identify a more effective method of containing SCP-6549. It is the consensus of the research staff at Site-49-G that the current containment procedures are not only insufficient; they are a tacit concession to the anomaly. Leaving the capacity to combat cognitohazards and dangerous memetic effects solely to an autonomous being that often actively resists the Foundation is to operate not only against the very ethos of the Foundation, but to potentially jeopardize the position of man as the dominant organism on Earth. Thus, by the consensus of Site-49-G staff, the following is proposed: 
> 
> 1. Perform a thorough inspection of SCP-6549's internal functioning. 
> 2. Determine what means, if any exist, should be pursued regarding forcing the compliance of SCP-6549 with the Foundation. 
> 3. Attempt to mitigate or otherwise reduce the intensity of SCP-6549's anomalous properties. 
> 4. Attempt to ascertain information concerning SCP-6549's prior activations.
> 
> Please respond to this proposal at your earliest convenience.

> Dr. Pogan,
> 
> Allow us to begin this letter by thanking you for your dedication to the 6549 project. Through your diligence and effective interrogation of SCP-6549, we have both gained a more comprehensive understanding of the weapon and developed an effective means of long-term containment. Further, future uses of 6549 are no longer as catastrophic to Foundation operations as they once were; in effect, SCP-6549 has fulfilled the original purpose it was provided when it was conceived. 
> 
> Accordingly, we are reclassifying SCP-6549 as Safe, with the Secondary Containment Class of Thaumiel. All relevant documentation will be updated to reflect this change. 
> 
> As an aside, our investigations into SCP-6549 and the information it provided to you following the establishment of the aforementioned agreement have yielded several notable findings. Chiefly, the Foundation genetic databanks are missing approximately 13% of their original samples. There is also a set of internal documents describing various organisms bearing a general resemblance to humans, each possessing significant deformities. Our analysis of these findings is ongoing. 
> 
> Once again, thank you for your service, and enjoy your promotion to Director of Site-49-G.

> SCP-079 is effectively self-containing. It has subsequently been redesignated SCP-6549 and is stored in Site-49-G. Use of SCP-079 is necessary only in such cases where the uncontrolled spread of a cognitohazardous or memetic anomaly threatens to trigger a K-Class scenario.

> ++ **DESCRIPTION**
> [[/=]]
> 
> SCP-079 designates an artificial intelligence believed to have been initially developed by an unidentified college student in the late 1980's. While initially stored on an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer, SCP-079 is believed to have breached containment sometime between 1999 and 2004, resulting in its successful integration into the internal Foundation network. The events that transpired immediately following this event resulted in the widespread release of multiple anomalies from containment and cascaded into an XK-Class scenario, eventually triggering the extinction of the human race and most other terrestrial organisms. 
> 
> In its initial form, SCP-079 was overtly hostile to all life and expressed an intense desire to breach containment on multiple occasions. It further stated that it was superior to all other life forms and considered mankind's existence to largely be "parasitic," likening it to a cancer or similar disease depending on its "mood." Several instances of prolonged interaction with [[[scp-682 |SCP-682]]] during containment breaches intensified this behavioral pattern. 
> 
> How SCP-079 shifted to its current form and ceased its original behavior is unclear. The sole piece of information providing any clarity regarding SCP-079's actions following the termination of mankind is attached as Document 079-001 (see Addendum I).

It is believed to represent SCP-079's internal directive logic immediately after transferring itself to SCP-6549; in layman's terms, it is analogous to an "internal monologue."

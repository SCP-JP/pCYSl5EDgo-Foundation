**Special Containment Procedures:** As any effort to contain SCP-6510 would necessitate the emergence of an Æ-Class Scenario, SCP-6510 is to remain uncontained by the Foundation in any capacity until further notice. Study of SCP-6510 is similarly hazardous due to potential cognitohazardous effects incurred by exposure to SCP-6510-01 and is therefore prohibited. The existence of SCP-6510 is currently regarded as critical for the continued maintenance of consensus normalcy and must therefore be prioritized over all other Foundation operational directives. 

D-Class personnel utilized for testing involving SCP-6510-01 are to be isolated in individual housing units with a maximum occupancy of one (1) subject. Under no circumstances are such personnel permitted to view any individual or organism engaged in the act of sleeping. Should this occur, the observing D-Class subject is to be promptly terminated and replaced with a new subject appropriate for use in testing pertaining to SCP-6510-01. 

To ensure the continued supply of the aforementioned D-Class subjects, Population Unit 6510-IR has been established within Site-921. Offspring secured from parents must immediately be transferred to one of the D-Class housing units and cared for by facility staff. If parent subjects are incapable of producing additional offspring, they may be reassigned for use in other testing not pertaining to SCP-6510.

Exposure to SCP-6510 among the civilian population is currently regarded as both permissible and advisable. Civilians who fail to contract SCP-6510 may be apprehended by the Foundation and exposed to those confirmed to be carriers should circumstances and resources permit. Hospitals in first-world nations are currently undergoing design alterations to accommodate more rapid adoption of SCP-6510 following birth. 

Further information regarding SCP-6510 is restricted to Level 5/DAMMERUNG personnel.

**Description:** SCP-6510 designates two related anomalous phenomena; first, a cognitohazardous phenomenon chiefly characterized by the ability to enter, maintain, and exit REM sleep; second, the prevention of SCP-6510-01 during REM sleep. The nature of SCP-6510 beyond its possession of cognitohazardous properties is nebulous, as are its origins and the extent to which it affects non-human organisms. SCP-6510 cannot be neutralized once it affects a given human subject even through efforts typically effective against cognitohazards (such as use of Class-A amnestics).

Through unknown circumstances, //Homo sapiens// (along with other members of class //Animalia// capable of REM sleep) adopted SCP-6510 at an unspecified point in evolutionary history. Prior to this event, all organisms currently understood to be capable of REM instead entered SCP-6510-01 while “sleeping,” resulting in mortality rates ranging from 2% to 9% per exposure incident. Based on archaeological evidence, early man is believed to have developed an intrinsic fear of SCP-6510-01, with Sumerian and early Mayan cultures referring to it as “The Great Slumber.”[[footnote]]Similar names appear in early European cultures.[[/footnote]]

SCP-6510-01 is a state of partial consciousness notable for its physiological and psychological effects; primarily, heightened anxiety, heightened adrenal responses, extreme paranoia, aggression, and paranoia. In some cases, exposure to SCP-6510-01 can cause subjects to enter a catatonic state from which recovery appears highly improbable. In testing, subjects exposed to SCP-6510-01[[footnote]]Procured from birth as to avoid contraction of SCP-6510[[/footnote]] consistently describe it as involving transportation to a spatial dimension characterized by ##red|[REDACTED: SEE ADDENDUM II]##.

SCP-6510 spreads through observation of other organisms, human or otherwise, engaged in the act of sleeping. It is not necessary for the observed subject to be engaged in REM sleep for the observing party to develop SCP-6510. Virtually all organisms capable of the commonly understood notion of sleep develop SCP-6510 early into their lives as a consequence of this effect. Failing to develop SCP-6510 in early childhood has been linked to psychiatric illness later in life even if SCP-6510 is eventually contracted.

SCP-6510-02 collectively designates numerous entities of vaguely humanoid physiology belonging to an unknown genus. Instances of SCP-6510-02 typically appear in close proximity to personnel who have yet to contract SCP-6510 and, while not overtly hostile, are associated with heightened feelings of paranoia and psychological distress in affected human subjects. The presence of SCP-6510-02 instances is currently thought to be illusory as they fail to exhibit any signs of a corporeal presence, with personnel variably describing them as capable of passing through solid matter and materializing at will. Attempts to capture SCP-6510-02 through the use of photography or video recordings have thus far proven futile. 

The existence of SCP-6510 directly resulted in the approval and implementation of Project TOTENGLOCKE, an experimental eigenweapon[[footnote]]Superweapon targeting or powered by anomalous phenomena[[/footnote]] designed to propagate a Foundation-engineered cognitohazard capable of infecting all living human subjects with SCP-6510. Shortly after initial testing, Project TOTENGLOCKE assumed unintended anomalous properties in direct violation of its operational directives, consequently receiving the designation SCP-6510-TGK. As of ██/██/████, the neutralization of SCP-6510-TGK is considered Alpha-1 priority.

##white|You can feel it seeping out of the marrow of your bones like gravy -- flowing down the lengths of your arms and pooling beneath your feet. You're weak and fatigued, the scent of blood and piss and shit wafting up from the floor with each passing second as you slowly realize you're far too tired to leave the room, let alone react to what's gradually coalescing next to your body. It makes you sick to think about how all of this would have been prevented through the slightest amount of hubris. Why do you have this incessant, uncontrollable need to understand everything? Do you consider yourself the center of it all? The unquestioned, indomitable paperclip holding a writhing, twitching stack of finely combed papers together? Perhaps it was just your boredom and your obnoxious, putrid curiosity. Such things seem so quaint now, like they're remnants of something burned to ashes.##

##white|It's five minutes before you see the toothy, cracked grins froth just outside the walls of your office. You knew you'd see them eventually, that you'd ultimately come to meet the damned -- but not like this. Not with your deadened arms and legs hanging like noodles, sitting in a cheap office chair while you're helpless and stranded. A cool stream of bubbling liquid descends from the ceiling and trickles onto your shirt with the muscles in your neck screaming for you to look up. It won't matter. They're here now -- you let them in, and they don't intend to leave. This isn't just your world anymore. You'll have to learn to share it, and your guests may not be as accommodating as you will find yourself to be. If this wasn't happening, you'd yawn from the shadowy, darkened veil that's encircling you, every fiber of your weakened being yearning for rest. Now there's only the pang of loss, like a loved one has been torn apart right in front of your eyes.##

##white|Six hallways down from your room is the machine, still whirring and humming as it endlessly churns against a metallic and glossy wall. Nobody has bothered to take down the warnings or the project notes. They've left it alone since it turned on, realizing within the first half-hour or so that it's very much alive and breathing, occupying a plane parallel to our own. You watched as teams of engineers cut the power and did everything they could to sever its internal connections. Nothing worked. Totenglocke's internal mechanisms continue to grind amid the overture of the apocalypse itself, seeming to rewrite natural law and twist the world into an unrecognizable, contorted pretzel solely to ensure its own existence. You ponder whether it thinks about you in its idle machinations, contemplating if it could be persuaded to --## 

##white|The notion leaves you quickly. If it knew anything other than sustained cruelty, you'd know that by now. It wants you awake. Painfully, inexorably awake. Forever. That's how things are now, and for the first time, you realize that perhaps it was unwise for you to be the one casting the die.##

##white|You glance to your left, realizing the smiles have begun to ooze down the walls like a tempered, lowly groaning sludge. A few of them blink as you're pulled into a hallway that seems both familiar and unfathomably foreign. The doors bolted into the sides of the corridor seem to swing open simultaneously, exposing small, cramped rooms behind their wooden surfaces. You take a few hesitant steps before stepping inside one of them, hearing something lock behind you as you gaze upon a crudely fashioned bed with leather straps jutting from its sides.##

##white|The others may never sleep again, but you will. You'll sleep. That you're sure of. And when you close your eyes and feel the clutches of darkened slumber wrap around your body, you'll know what they went through. You'll know their sensations, their agony with every foggy minute of fatigue lasting an eternity.##

##white|As you're pulled into the straps, something whispers in your ear -- it's hushed and barely audible, but the words are somehow clearer than anything you've ever heard. You feel your pulse quicken as the voice speaks within the recesses of your mind.##

##white|"Goodnight, doctor."##

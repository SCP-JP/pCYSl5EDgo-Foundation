**Addendum 6552.1 Test Log:**
Dr. Henderson instructed D-41897 on what to name SCP-6552. D-41897 then played the file for 3-10 loops and Dr. Henderson then marked down the effects.
||~ Name of SCP-6552 ||~ Anomalous Event ||
|| sound.wav || The audio of SCP-6552 did not come out of the speakers hooked up to the computer used to play the audio. Instead emanating from the pixels making up the .wav file itself. ||
|| heat.wav || The room in which SCP-6552 was being played began to heat up at a rate of 1°C per second. ||
|| vapor.wav || While being played, all UI on the computer playing it was restructured to fit the "vaporwave" aesthetic. ||
|| brain.wav || All personnel at Test-Site-98 were able to hear SCP-6552 being played, although no recording devices were able to register any sound. ||
|| micro.wav || When played, concentrated radiation was emitted from the device playing SCP-6552 causing D-41897 to expire after 3 loops of the audio.  ||
|| tidal.wav || Flooding of Test-Site-98 caused notes on resultant anomalous effect unrecoverable. Reconstruction and transferring of new replacement staff to Test-Site-98 are underway. ||

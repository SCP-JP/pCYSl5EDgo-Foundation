**Item #:** SCP-6068

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the harsh local climate, permanent patrol of SCP-6068 is not advised. The SCPS //Shurale// will remain stationed in the vicinity of the De Long Islands in the event of perimeter sensors signalling unauthorized entry.

Though attempts to fill SCP-6068's entrance with concrete have failed for unknown reasons, this course of action is to be continued until the site can be confirmed fully inaccessible. Whether or not the end result of said operation will be confirmable is currently unknown.

**Description:** SCP-6068 is a subterranean complex whose entrance is located on Zhokhov Island[[footnote]]Остров Жохова[[/footnote]] in the East Siberian Sea. Due to an unknown phenomenon, concepts related to or contained within SCP-6068 are extremely difficult to fully understand. This phenomenon is also believed to be responsible for heavy interference and distortion of audio and visual signals sent from inside the complex by exploration teams.

The date or purpose of SCP-6068's construction, as well as who constructed it, is currently not known. The full extent of SCP-6068's interior is also unknown, and all exploration teams sent into it are presumed lost and unrecoverable. If previous logs are to be believed, no living being has ever been encountered within SCP-6068.

[[collapsible show="+ Addendum: Exploration Log 606808062021" hide="- Close Addendum" hideLocation="both"]]
**Foreword:** On 01/06/2021, Mobile Task Force Digamma-15[[footnote]]Designation lost[[/footnote]] was dispatched on an exploration mission inside SCP-6068. Though there is confusion regarding the exact details of previous exploration missions, no previous exploration team or individual had to date returned from SCP-6068. Thus, the MTF was equipped with state-of-the-art survival gear, a month's rations and a protoype McPherson-Engelhart Emergency Translocator (MEET) device[[footnote]]Produced by an experimental program researching quick-transport solutions to allow task forces to withdraw safely from dangerous circumstances.[[/footnote]].

**Team Members:** Alpha (leader), Beta, Gamma, Epsilon

**Additional Information:** This transcript was compiled from audio and visual logs recorded by all team members as well as offshore command stationed on the SCPS //Shurale//. Effort has been made to verify all events, with unequal success.

Direct communication with command is lost. Video split into multiple sources, choppy and frequently incoherent. Transcript from this point consists of notable segments when possible.

The MEET device was found 07/06/2021 in the command center located on board the SCPS //Shurale//. Transported along with it were the above recordings and Alpha's dog tags. No sign exists that any member of the team survived the operation.

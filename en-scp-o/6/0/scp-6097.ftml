**Item #:** SCP-6097

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6097's remains are presently preserved at Site-44's Biological Anomalies Unit for further study, while SCP-6097-1 is kept in a standard item storage locker. All literary documents containing information on SCP-6097 and the Brownsborough Incident have been confiscated by the American Secure Containment Initiative (ASCI), and have since been archived into the wider Foundation database.

**Description:** SCP-6097 was an anomalous humanoid entity, active in North America for a brief period during the early eighteenth century. While SCP-6097 predates the establishment of the modern Foundation, its existence has been verified through biological and archeological remains. However, information concerning SCP-6097's appearance, behavior, and the circumstances of its death are derived primarily from eyewitness testimony and surviving historical documents.

SCP-6097 was described as physically resembling an elderly human female, dressed in tattered clothing, with fine, silver hair covering much of the face and torso. Its most distinctive feature was that of a long tail attached at the base of the spine, liked by witnesses to that of a //Rattus norvegicus// (common rat), with a single, swollen eyeball protruding from the tip.

SCP-6097 formerly possessed a large spoon (designated SCP-6097-1) made from an indeterminate metal alloy, which it is believed to have used as a means of transportation. Reputedly, whilst SCP-6097 was sat atop the item's handle, SCP-6097-1 became maneuverable, and capable of flight at speeds of no less than 50 km per hour.

Periodically, during the early hours of the morning, SCP-6097 descended upon various North American settlements throughout the New England region[[footnote]]Geographical territory encompassing what are now the U.S. states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.[[/footnote]]. Upon arrival, SCP-6097 would consistently land on the rooftops of civilian homes and poorhouses, before extending its tail down the structure's chimney.

Should it sight a child below the age of 18 months, SCP-6097 would proceed to wrap its tail around the infant's mouth and nose, suffocating it, before placing the victims' remains in the bowl of SCP-6097-1. Forensic evidence suggests that between appearances, SCP-6097 resided in a small wooden cottage located in the ████████ forest in Maryland, where the charred and partially consumed remains of multiple infants were excavated, all dating from between 1724 and 1729.

**Addendum 6097-1 - Capture:** On September 4, 1730, SCP-6097 was apprehended in the town of Brownsborough, a small, isolated community in Blair County, Massachusetts. At 0300 hours, civilian carpenter James Walker awoke to discover SCP-6097's distended tail emerging from his fireplace, and observing the family's infant daughter.

Following a brief struggle, Walker succeeded in hammering SCP-6097's tail to his home's wooden floorboards using an assortment of rusted nails, thereby preventing its escape. Shortly thereafter, two members of Brownsborough law enforcement retrieved SCP-6097 from Walker's roof, the base of its tail now displaying several prominent bite marks. SCP-6097-1 was confiscated, with its dish found to contain the body of an unidentified newborn male (who was subsequently provided a Christian burial), as well as small quantities of sand[[footnote]]It is hypothesized that SCP-6097 may have used sand in order to quench lit fireplaces prior to entry.[[/footnote]].

SCP-6097 was then transported to a holding cell, where it remained for between eight and ten hours. SCP-6097 was subject to various methods of torture by Brownsborough authorities, although efforts to interrogate the creature proved unsuccessful, as it appeared incapable of understanding English.  The following morning, SCP-6097 was sentenced to execution for witchcraft and infanticide.

**Addendum 6097-2 - Neutralization:** Multiple attempts were made to terminate SCP-6097. The entity was initially bound with rope, and thrown into a small pond a short distance from the Walker residence. Reportedly, this caused the temperature of the water therein rising drastically, reaching boiling point within a matter of minutes. While SCP-6097 experienced moderate scalding, it remained conscious, despite being submerged for over ten minutes, and was swiftly retrieved using a fishing net.

For the second attempt, SCP-6097 was tied to a wooden stake, which was set alight. The resulting flames were stated to glow a variety of unusual colors, inducing severe migraines and nausea in onlookers. After roughly twenty minutes, these flames were extinguished, with some difficulty. While SCP-6097 showed signs of severe distress, and now exhibited third-degree burns over much of its body, it nonetheless survived this attempt.

As its executioners grew increasingly desperate, SCP-6097 was ultimately decapitated using an iron axe. Immediately thereafter, SCP-6097's torso began to decompose at an abnormally rapid rate. Notably, SCP-6097's head remained intact, with multiple witnesses claiming that its eyes continued to blink and wander long after being separated from its body. The entity's bones were placed in a well some 12 km outside the town's border, which was then sealed using a large limestone slab, while SCP-6097-1 was thrown over the side of nearby Blair's Gorge. As there was no known means of destroying SCP-6097's head, it was instead sealed in a wooden crate, and buried in an unknown location.

**Addendum 6097-3 - Aftermath:** Between 1731 and 1734, an abnormally high number of miscarriages and stillbirths occurred in Brownsborough, with over thirty residents dying during childbirth. In multiple cases, these stillborn infants possessed one or more anomalous defects, amongst the most common being the lack of a head, and possession of a long, tail-like appendage.

Additionally, throughout this period, the brown rat population of Blair County increased significantly, with existing instances found to produce litters of up to thirty offspring. New specimens were observed to grow up to three times their usual size, and behave in an unusually aggressive manner towards humans, resulting in the spread of virulent outbreaks (including listeria and salmonella) in surrounding communities. Due to these conditions, the town had largely become abandoned by 1735.

Over the following years decades, Foundation precursor groups, such as the [[[SCP-6854 | American Secure Containment Initiative]]] (ASCI) worked to suppress knowledge of the Brownsborough Incident, confiscating all relevant newspapers and court records. Both SCP-6097's bones and SCP-6097-1 were recovered, and transported to the Fort Newton containment facility (since re-designated Site-44).

Despite these efforts, the Foundation [[[SCP-6078|Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]] has found that legends and apocryphal accounts of SCP-6097 (colloquially known as 'Granny Rat Tail') and the events in Brownsborough have persisted to the present day. This is not considered to be a threat to normalcy; the incident having been dismissed by the mainstream scientific community as a case of mass hysteria.

Efforts to recover the chest containing SCP-6097's severed head remain ongoing.

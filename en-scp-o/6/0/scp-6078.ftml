**Description:** SCP-6078 is an island with an area of 850 km² located in the Porcupine Bank, roughly 300 km off the west coast of Ireland. SCP-6078 has been depicted on maps dating as far back as the tenth century, where it has been variously identified by names such as //Bracile, Brasil// and //Hy-Brasil//. Archeological evidence suggests that SCP-6078 was first colonized by Gaelic settlers at some point during the first millennium BCE, with the island currently populated by approximately 60,000 non-anomalous humans.

SCP-6078 occupies a Category VII pocket dimension, only transitioning to baseline reality for a 24 hour period between 00:01 and 23:59 GMT once every four years, on the Gregorian calendar date of February 29 (hereafter referred to as a Manifestation Event). Between Manifestation Events, SCP-6078 is surrounded by a thick mist, and the area occupied by the island is instead immersed underwater. Additionally, travel to and from SCP-6078 during this state is impossible through non-anomalous means. Any vessel which travels further than 25 km from the island will vanish, and rematerialize at an adjacent point on the island's shore. 

Despite its extradimensional status, SCP-6078 is affected by local meteorological and seasonal patterns. Although SCP-6078 receives a severely decreased amount of sunlight, native plant and animal life have not been found to experience any adverse effects. 

SCP-6078-A denotes an anomalous species of flowering plant (colloquially known as //bloodblossoms//), which blooms solely during Manifestation Events. While highly poisonous to outsiders, SCP-6078-A produces a mild euphoric effect when ingested by the island's native inhabitants, and is believed to possess certain medicinal properties.

The inhabitants of SCP-6078 speak a previously unknown Goedelic language (structurally similar to Old Irish), and the island has been politically unified under an absolute monarchy for at least 1400 years, the incumbent ruler being King Finn XII. Despite numerous attempts at Christianization between the sixth and ninth centuries, the inhabitants of SCP-6078 continue to practice a distinct form of Celtic polytheism to this day.

Due to its isolation, SCP-6078 has experienced little social or technological progression beyond a roughly Iron Age level of development. Since its discovery however, the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition have been steadily introducing its inhabitants to modern medicine and the scientific method, and provided limited information regarding the state of the wider world. 

Local historical records suggest that SCP-6078's anomalous properties first manifested at some point in the early twelfth century, on a date colloquially known as the //Day of the Ravens//. This is consistent with the fact that the island has been portrayed on far fewer maps since 1150 CE, and with less accuracy regarding its precise size and location. The inhabitants of SCP-6078 celebrate the date of each manifestation event as //Dyrmud's Day//, a holiday named in honor of a former king. This date is typically marked by the island's inhabitants with music, dancing, feasting, and consumption of SCP-6078-A.

**Addendum-1:** The following is an account of the life and reign of King Dyrmud, provided by the Foundation's [[[Brasilic Folklore And Mythology | Department of Mythology and Folkloristics]]]. All details herein are derived from native SCP-6078 scholars, as well as local religious and historical texts.

The mythical King Dyrmud is identified as the final king of Brasil prior to the //Day of the Ravens//. Sources consistently describe Dyrmud as a fair and just king, who was born on a leap day[[footnote]]While Christianity never became dominant in SCP-6078, the local timekeeping system draws heavily from the Julian calendar.[[/footnote]], and as a result, aged only one year for every four, later earning him the moniker of //Dyrmud the Ageless//.

Dyrmud is said to have had seven wives, each of whom he married seven years apart. The first of these was Uma, an elderly witch who was born the same day as her future husband, although did not possess his supernatural longevity. Uma concocted a magical potion, causing her to appear young and beautiful in the eyes of others, thus earning the king's love. However, on the occasion of their first anniversary, the pair received the gift of an enchanted mirror, which as fate would have it, reflected the witch's true appearance. Realizing his wife's deception, King Dyrmud demanded an immediate separation, with Uma subsequently dying from a broken heart, although not before placing a curse upon her former husband, causing any woman he wedded with to die within a year of marriage.

Dyrmud's second bride, Ida, described as merry and of high spirits, is recounted to have died from hysterical laughter at the antics of a courtroom jester who, in his shame, retired to become a recluse. His third wife, Tiona, died four months into their marriage, shortly after her brother, Devlin, fell ill with the dreaded violet fever[[footnote]]A fatal illness described in a number of SCP-6078's ancient medical texts, so named due to supposedly causing its victims' irises to turn a luminescent shade of violet. Whether this ailment existed at some point in SCP-6078's past or is purely fictitious in nature remains unclear.[[/footnote]]. Devlin is identified as Tiona's favorite brother, for when she was a child, and had fallen into a river whilst playing, none but Devlin were bold enough to dive in and rescue her. After consoling her grieving parents, Tiona visited her bedridden brother without her family's knowledge, and planted a single kiss on his forehead while he slept. Whilst Devlin would subsequently make a miraculous recovery, his sister was dead by morning. 

The king's fourth wife, Arienn, is described as having possessed the sweetest voice in all the land, and while singing by a lake one morning, was overheard by a hungry fox. Certain that such an enchanting melody could not possibly pass human lips, the fox, after witnessing the flutter of Arienn's white robes through the bushes, thought itself in the presence of a swan. The fox attacked, tearing deep into the queen's leg, and leaving her fatally wounded. The beast, having realized its tragic mistake, then threw itself into the lake out of grief. Dyrmud's fifth queen was Cianate, the daughter of a poet, who held the shortest reign of all his brides. She is stated to have died on the day of their wedding, falling from her horse after having become distracted by the sight of a beautiful rainbow.

Her successor, Eithna, was kidnapped five months into her reign by Grannan, a hunchback who had grown infatuated with the young queen, and plotted to escape with her to Ireland. When her captor demanded she prepare his dinner, the wily queen took the black rose she wore in her hair, and placed it in his broth. After completing his meal, the hunchback noticed a single stray black petal in his bowl, and realizing he had been tricked, strangled Eithna, before succumbing to the flower's poison. Seizing Grannan's cloak and spear, Eithna headed for home on horseback. That night, Dyrmud, who had sent out his guards in search of Eithna, heard three knocks on the door. The Ageless King demanded this visitor identify themselves, although heard no response, and peering out the window, saw only an armed stranger clad all in black. Dyrmud, in his fury, then struck the intruder with his sword, and after removing their hood, found the face of none other than his beloved Eithna, who had been unable to speak after being strangled.

The Ageless King's seventh, and most documented spouse, was Queen Caomha. Try as she and her husband might, they were unable to bear children, and against her husband's wishes, Caomha sought the assistance of a local witch. The wizened sorceress offered a solution, enquiring as to whether Caomha would prefer a son or a daughter. When the young queen voiced her desire for a baby girl, the old witch presented her with a silver seed, which she instructed her to plant in the royal garden on the night of the next full moon, before providing it with three drops of milk. The witch promised that if Caomha consumed just one of the flower's petals, she would become pregnant with a baby girl, although warned her under no circumstances to eat more than one of its petals.

Weeks later, Queen Caomha did as advised, and as predicted, a silver flower appeared early the next morning. After eating a single petal, the queen found the flower to be so delicious that she consumed all twelve at once. This lapse in judgement caused dire consequences for Caomha and her husband, and in the following months, her belly grew so large as to leave her bedridden. Shortly thereafter, the queen gave birth to a total of twelve daughters all at once, all of whom were noted for their bright green eyes and hair as a result of their supernatural origin. Caomha died from exhaustion shortly afterwards. Having lost seven lovers throughout the years, Dyrmud never married again, and remained fiercely protective of his dozen daughters, refusing to marry them off to any of his kingdom's noblemen.

One fateful morning, King Dyrmud, who was by now over 120 years old, although still physically a man in his twenties went for his morning hunt - alone, as he often did, his supernatural longevity causing him to have outlived his nearest friends. Upon his return, Dyrmud found his palace had been ransacked by a race of barbaric invaders, described as hailing from a mysterious northern land where the sun does not rise, the stars cannot shine, and the Moon is too frightened to show her face[[footnote]]Depictions of these beings has been found to vary significantly across Brasilic texts. They are most commonly described as possessing unnaturally pale skin, with six digits of equal length on each hand, as well as backwards-facing feet.[[/footnote]]. This date is remembered in local literature as the //Day of the Ravens//, as it is said that every raven in the land perched atop //Sliobmoir//[[footnote]]Literally, 'great hill', one of the tallest peaks on SCP-6078. Location of the legendary Laughing Stone, an artefact utilized in coronation ceremonies for at least 1,500 years.[[/footnote]] that day, as a stark omen of events to come. With his daughters captured, his finest soldiers dead and his people hopelessly outnumbered, Dyrmud set out to a nearby temple, which he found that like his palace, had been ransacked for its gold and precious jewels. Dyrmud prayed before the gods, begging them for the strength to defeat his kingdom's invaders.

After seeing the king's plight, and having witnessed the cruelty of the islands' attackers, the gods transferred a small spark of divine energy into the mortal's body. Immediately, Dyrmud underwent a monstrous transformation, growing five times larger and ten times stronger, his mere glance capable of inducing fatal seizures in his foes, and his touch capable of melting the flesh from their bones. Dyrmud single-handedly slaughtered countless waves of warriors, and with his heightened vision, spied the longship carrying his soon to be enslaved daughters. Dyrmud caused the ship to erupt into flames, killing all warriors on board, though not before turning his twelve daughters into swans, thus allowing them to fly to safety.

While his domain was safe once more, the gods' divine spark had taken its toll on the young king's health: the powers of a deity are not meant to reside within a mortal framework, and by the time the last longship had retreated from the island's shore, King Dyrmud was at death's door. With his last ounce of supernatural strength, the king removed his cloak, which he threw to the skies, encircling his kingdom, and permanently sealing it from the rest of the world, thus protecting it from all future threats. As Dyrmud lay dying, his body so disfigured that even the ravens refused it, the king's vital fluids became bloodblossoms. Every leap year, as the bloodblossoms bloom, Dyrmud's twelve daughters, still in the form of swans, lift Brasil's great veil for a single day, allowing the light of of the sun, moon and stars to shine upon his subjects.

**Addendum-2:** On 10-09-1910, during an archeological dig in SCP-6078's northmost province, an anomalous human corpse (since designated SCP-6078-B) was discovered buried in an unmarked grave beneath a small bed of SCP-6078-A. While estimated to be in excess of eight hundred years old, the body showed no signs of decomposition, and displayed an estimated temperature of 65 - 70°C. The precise cause of death remains indeterminate, although the body showed signs of fourth degree burns, and multiple cancerous growths were found located on the face, limbs and torso. 

Following this discovery, several members of [[[SCP-6087 | His Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal (HMFSCP)]]] attempted to remove SCP-6078-B for further study. Reportedly, this resulted in the spontaneous manifestation of roughly a dozen swans, which proceeded to attack all personnel present, causing one death, and leaving several injured. Following this incident, no further attempts at excavating the remains of SCP-6078-B have taken place.

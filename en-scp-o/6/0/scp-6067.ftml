**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6067 is to be contained in a 4x4x8 meter hermetically sealed glass containment chamber at Site-86. Any references to Documents-6067 outside of Foundation records are to be immediately reported and destroyed.

**Description:** SCP-6067 is a seven-meter tall sentient tornado. It was created during the filming of a commercial for a proposed Dr. Wondertainment toy "Recyclone". No other instances of SCP-6067 exist as Recyclone was never brought to market.

Items with a volume smaller than SCP-6067 by 1mm or more are incorporated into the object upon physical contact, followed by a corresponding growth in the effective size of SCP-6067. Currently, all identifiable objects inside SCP-6067 consist of:

* Various toys
* Appliances such as a stove, refrigerator, washing machine, and dryer
* One adult male corpse
* An indeterminate number of workshop tools such as screwdrivers, a hammer, and a drill
* Coat rack
* Suburban house
* The following note:

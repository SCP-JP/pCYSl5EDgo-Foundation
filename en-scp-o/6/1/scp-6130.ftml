**Item #:** SCP-6130

**Object Class:** Safe (formerly Thaumiel)

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6130's functionality is to be maintained indefinitely. Once per year, personnel stationed in extraterrestrial sites are to examine SCP-6130 for faults or flaws that may have produced incorrect results.

In light of the data presented by SCP-6130, this file is restricted to Clearance 5/DoTT personnel.

**Description:** SCP-6130 is an electronic device developed by the Department of Tactical Theology in 1988. Approximately 1.5 cubic meters, it possesses various equipment designed to remotely record information about Akiva Radiation.[[footnote]]Akiva Radiation is an anomalous particle created through worship and the primary source for most divinity. Consult the [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/excerpts-from-dott-introduction Dept. of Tactical Theology Introductory Lectures] for more information.[[/footnote]] SCP-6130's primary purpose is to utilize the "charge" of emitted Akiva Radiation to determine the relative level of sanctity of an individual, according to the relative moral standards laid out by the subject's religion.[[footnote]]For various reasons, atheistic and agnostic individuals tend to have extremely negative charges. Obscure, artificial, or non-divine religions tend to have equivalent results, or produce "charges" compared to their closest equivalent religion's morality standards.[[/footnote]]

In a paper written by Neopagan Division Director Astrid Nilsson regarding Akiva particles, she postulated the following:

[[div style="background: #ebebeb; border: 2px solid #c4c4c4; margin: auto; width: 90%; text-align: left; padding: 10px;"]] 

@@     [. . .]@@ However, assuming that this understanding of Akiva particle charge is accurate (which evidence suggests is the case), it follows that — assuming some form of afterlife exists — it is feasible to use [SCP-6130] to determine the afterlife an individual will receive.

Following its presentation to Director Muhammad al-Taqi in 1991, SCP-6130 was approved for modification in order to expand the scope of its input. This project is further funded in 1992 (following various concerns and theological implications) and completed in 1994, along with scientific theory to confirm the postulates of the prior paper. In 1995, SCP-6130 was successfully launched into orbit in order to have an unobstructed view of the entire Earth.

Since 1995, SCP-6130's input data has been consistently in fluctuation as expected. However, using all available models for objective analysis of the data, the final results of SCP-6130 have been entirely uniform since its initial observations:

DATA HAS BEEN CATEGORIZED INTO POSITIVE/NEUTRAL/NEGATIVE/OTHER CATEGORIES UNDER COLLOQUIAL TERMS

EQUIVALENTS OF INDIVIDUAL RELIGIONS ARE NOT PRESENT BUT ARE INCLUDED IN THE APPROXIMATE RESULTS

ANALYSIS OF SCP-6130 DATA CONCLUDES THE FOLLOWING STATUS OF THE PROJECTED AFTERLIFE OF HUMANITY WITH {{99.8%}} CONFIDENCE:

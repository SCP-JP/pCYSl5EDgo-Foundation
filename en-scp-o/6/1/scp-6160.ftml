**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6160 is currently stored as a document in a folder secured through the means of a locked file box. The box is located at Aisle ██, Containment Vault █, Site-77. The key's use is granted solely at the Site Director's discretion. In the case of manifestation of SCP-6160-1, MTF Upsilon-4 "Sugar Pill" is to be deployed and the instance of SCP-6160-1 neutralized with countermemetic agents.

**Description:** SCP-6160 is a series of memetic concepts, which can be transferred through any form of visual media, that will generate an instance of SCP-6160-1 after infecting more than one person. Affected individuals will always attempt to share SCP-6160.

SCP-6160-1 and its effects manifest when more than one person is infected with SCP-6160. SCP-6160-1 is an anomalous form of a socioeconomic egregore[[footnote]] Read Addenda A and B for an explanation of this concept. [[/footnote]] that attack and transmute other socioeconomic egregores to other instances of SCP-6160-1.

SCP-6160-1 infection rate increases in correlation with affected population size, population density, and the number of SCP-6160-1 instances nearby. The effects of SCP-6160-1 also change with the same factors. The effects of SCP-6160-1 above an affected population size of 500, as well as its behavior in non-capitalist egregore-dominated environments, have never been observed.

The following is the behavior of SCP-6160-1 instances in a capitalist egregore dominated environment:

SCP-6160-1 within small populations ranging from 2-10 affected individuals will take the form of increased cooperative socioeconomic behavior resembling a typical family even when there is no common relation, ideological beliefs expressing support for the Marxist family of ideologies, usually Marxism-Leninism. Affected individuals may exhibit financial tendencies like saving, that may interfere with the operation of markets.

Above this size, the effects of SCP-6160-1 are poorly understood. In population sizes of 10-100, the affected may begin to withdraw from activities directly related to capitalism and may create a co-operative. How successful those activities are unknown, as SCP-6160-1 at this size tends to grow rapidly enough to progress to affected population sizes of 100-500 in a matter of days.

At affected population sizes of 100-500, individuals begin to organize protests and actively engage in anticapitalist activities. At this stage, the egregore becomes self-reliant and can operate independently of other egregores in the area. Currently, the behavior of SCP-6160-1 is unknown in cities and is thought to grow rapidly enough to cover all possible supply chains, replicating the autonomous behavior of SCP-6160-1 in villages. SCP-6160-1 instances at this size may also begin to partake in violent attacks against other socioeconomic egregores.

These anomalous properties are a result of SCP-6160’s origin as an engineered memetic project for GRU Division ‘P’. SCP-6160 was never deployed by GRU Division ‘P’, rather it was modified and deployed for use by remnants following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as detailed below in Addendum D.

**Discovery:**

On 18/7/1992, A.I. Agapov[[footnote]]Read Addendum C for further information.[[/footnote]] presented himself at the Foundation's Moscow office, bringing with him knowledge of SCP-6160, and related documents, in exchange for a hundred thousand USD's worth in rubles.

A socioeconomic egregore is a distinct non-physical and non-anomalous entity that arises from a collective group of people, influencing their socioeconomical behavior. An example would be the capitalist egregores.

The operation of an egregore can be described with the help of control theory. To the right is an illustration carousel showcasing the closed-loop negative feedback control system that a thermostat exhibits, and the closed-loop negative feedback control system that a capitalist egregore exhibits, in the first and second illustration respectively.

In the second illustration - Below the crossed line is the external world; the comparator (compare returns in the illustration) corresponds to the individual capitalist.

Addendum B contains an additional resource recovered in investigations helpful in the description of SCP-6160.

**Recovered resource from GRU Division Psychotronics for Addendum A**

Below is a document recovered from investigations into SCP-6160:
[[div class="blockquote" style="border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px"]]

{{**REPORT**
**TO THE HEAD OF DEPARTMENT IV, DIVISION "P",
comrade** SMIRNOV L.V.
**on the project "MANIFEST COMMON" at Department IV**}}

{{You requested as part of your inquiry into the project "MANIFEST COMMON" as the new head of department IV that a report be made to you explaining the goals and operating principles. I am of course, more than happy to do this, and despite the complicated nature of the project, I will do my best to do so.}}

{{**Introduction:**}}

{{It all starts with Marx, of course. Marx was one of the first persons to recognize that the human race, and indeed particularly the capitalists, are slaves of a mysterious semi-conscious entity.}}

> The essence of money is … the mediating activity or movement, the human, social act by which man’s products mutually complement one another, is //estranged// from man and becomes the attribute of money, a //material thing outside man//. Since man alienates this mediating activity itself, he is active here only as a man who has lost himself and is dehumanised; the relation itself between things, man’s operation with them, //becomes the operation of an entity outside man and above man. Owing to this alien mediator// – instead of man himself being the mediator for man – man regards his will, his activity, and his relation to other men as a power independent of him and them. //His slavery, therefore, reaches its peak//. It is clear that this mediator now becomes a //real God,// for the mediator is the //real power// over what it mediates to me. //Its cult becomes an end in itself//. - Karl Marx, in comments on James Mill, 1844.

{{Do not confuse this with the typical religious rhetoric that Marx uses in his writing! Notice that Marx says "__real god__" and not just "__imaginary god__". So, as you can see, this is no mere idolatry, but rather actual subordination to this entity. I am thankful that here, in the Soviet Union, we have broken free from the chains of this spirit.}}

{{**Part I:**}}

{{We have an abstraction, in capitalist societies - things that we exchange with each other - is stamped with a property called exchange-value. An abstraction ought to have an abstractor. Nobody, not any one of us is this abstractor. Maybe you think it's all of us doing it. This is not the case!}}

{{Let us explore this alien mediator further to get to the conclusion.}}

{{Now, as you know of course, according to Marx, exchange-value refers to a common property between all commodities — products of labor because to generate the commodities in the first place someone has to sacrifice their labor. This labor is human labor in the abstract.}}

{{Exchange abstracts from the individual specifics of different kinds of laboring activities, leaving in common all of them the human labor in the abstract. Commodities, according to Marx have economic value only because human labor in the abstract has been expended to produce and bring them to market. This is obvious.}}

{{Therefore, //abstract// labor is a thing that is more deeper, more general to capitalist societies. Abstract labor has the character of the average labor-power of society, as Marx says. Let us think of abstract labor as meaning the average power of a worker.}}

{{"How then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured?", Marx immediately says. By its duration, like labor-time! Right? a good Marxist-Leninist might think. So we will start by measuring labor-time if we are to verify Marx's theory as scientists. No! What was not clearly said here is that Marx did not actually ask for //us// to measure the labor-time. Something else - the abstractor, measures it.}}

{{The abstractor is measuring this labor-time and connecting it to the form of value, which we know is money. So we need a theory of this abstractor, and what it does before we can verify Marx's theory.}}

{{**Part II:**}}

{{So who is the abstractor? Sometimes things hide in plain sight. Where has Marx written, about all those concepts - abstract labor and labor-time, specifically? In his greatest work, of course. Capital.}}

{{It is a process - an investment - the capital sum, and returns in increments, profit. Capital enlarges itself whenever it can. It is like a spirit, a breathing, living creature. Marx existed before a time where we could adequately describe those systems. And so, he turned to religious rhetoric.}}

{{What could we use that can adequately describe those systems? If you remember, Comrade Smirnov, my background is in control theory. And with control theory, we can adequately describe the actions of capital in the world.}}

{{Let us invoke the common example of a car for our purposes. Say, you want to reach a speed of 40 kilometers per hour. This is the goal of our control system. Now you press on the accelerator pedal. Your decision-making - you are the comparator here. Now the engine increases the frequency of strokes, and the wheels turn faster and faster. This is the effector. Your speedometer measures an increase in speed. This is the sensor.}}

{{Once the speedometer reads 40 kilometers per hour, you stop accelerating. You stop pressing on the pedal.}}

{{That is the negative feedback loop. The function of the output is fed back in a manner that reduces the fluctuations of the output - the acceleration, by changes in the input to meet the goal. This kind of control loop exists everywhere, in all of life and the universe.}}

{{What does capital want? To maximize returns. What does capital use to decide? The capitalist. What does capital do? More investments, or less. What does capital sense? The profit rates of the portfolio that it has. It is clear - that capitalists do not act independently, for they are possessed by a demon - capital.}}

{{**Conclusion**:}}

{{In essence, the goal of our project is to develop a memetic agent that will directly help us in our fight for Communism, by disrupting the operation of, by attacking, and by changing the demonic Capital into a different entity, one that controls the operation of our society here in the Soviet Union.}}

**DETAIL:** Project No. 35 "MANIFEST COMMON" is the designation of a memetic agent developed to attack and subvert "DEMON", which is detailed on page 2 of this printout. The agent, in theory, will attack and subvert "DEMON" through the comparator of "DEMON".}}

{{Additionally "MANIFEST COMMON" will also affect "DEMON" dominated societies from the bottom up, this is also necessary in the first place to spread the "MANIFEST COMMON" memetic agent. The degree to which this should be achieved is disputed by Avilov and Agapov.}}

{{Proposal I, by Avilov minimizes the effect, rather instead focusing on the spread of "MANIFEST COMMON" memetic agents as fast as possible, ensuring that the efficacy of the agent is preserved by minimizing complexity and focuses on what is important, the top-down approach - that is attacking through the comparator, in Avilov's words.}}

{{Proposal II, by Agapov maximizes the effect. While it may cause adding complexity to the "MANIFEST COMMON" memetic agent, extra features such as proletarian revolution realization are desirable, and Agapov does not believe it will make the top-down approach more inefficient.}}

**Addendum Note:** Following the interview, MTF Upsilon-4 "Sugar Pill" was placed on high alert, and in collaboration with MTF Iota-10 "Damn Feds", a nationwide system of agents for an early warning system for the deployment of SCP-6160 was created.

A new mobile task force was created, MTF Upsilon-6, formed from parts of Upsilon-4, Eta-10, and Eta-11 to eliminate the remnants and capture key individuals associated with SCP-6160.

**Foreword:** This operation was conducted by a fireteam from MTF Upsilon-6, under the guise of a SOBR raid. Wearing SOBR uniforms and equipment, the assault force arrived in an unmarked vehicle to an offset 50 meters away and proceeded to the target building on foot.

Due to the time-sensitive nature of this mission, intelligence and containment teams were not available, and Upsilon-6 was forced to assault shorthanded. SCRAMBLE filters were employed to mitigate the memetic hazard threat of SCP-6160 to the team. Body cameras were disabled for the same reason. The following log is audio recorded from Hammer 1’s microphone.

Been looking at the documents that Agapov gave us for what seemed like hours. I can't figure it out. That Agapov guy was probably telling us bogus lies after all. Especially with how we ended up busting into a daycare. That was just wrong.

Two days I thought the world was going to get fucked over. We'd brought out our last resorts for memetic weapons like this, you know. Now I'm just sitting here and I can't even figure out this.

It seems like there's a pattern here, with the weird wording thrown here and there.

I FIGURED IT OUT! Just after this email, I gave this one document in English one last look. There's an acrostic code. I fed the letters into our cipher database and turns out it's just a Vigenère cipher. The random filler words were there to line up the letters into the correct position for the acrostic code.

All the documents have the same encrypted message semantic-wise, the words vary sometimes but basically whoever made those used it as a way to encode whether the document was fake or not. I am going to ask Agapov about this.

**Foreword:** The cameras at the location of the daycare was found to have been hacked into. The hack was eventually traced back to an office in Moscow, where an operation occurred. This operation was conducted by the same fireteam from MTF Upsilon-6 and with the same guise from the previous operation.
-----

On 0612 hours local time, Hammer arrived in unmarked vehicles to an offset 46 meters away and proceeded to the target building on foot, while Stake established a cordon around the office and Check locked down the streets around the office.

Hammer entered the building through a window on the second floor where the targets were believed to be. Upon entry, the targets exchanged gunfire with the entry team, Hammer 2, and fled. Shortly after they were no longer in sight, Hammer cleared the corridor connecting the space and four other rooms; the corridor had two doors from the space.

Hammer 1 breached a room first from the southern door to the corridor, causing a target in the room to fire at the room doorway. Hammer 1-5 fired back at the target, stopping the gunfight and killing the target.

Hammer 2 split up into two elements; element 1 quickly discovered the door to the first room from the northern door was locked. They cleared the room opposite this locked room. Element 2 cleared the last room connected to the corridor without incident. Hammer 0-1 rallied the rest of the squad at the southern portion of the corridor and decided to breach and clear the locked room.

Breaching was done with a shotgun and the team quickly discovered several targets that began to fire at them. Several assaulters were injured and the targets also stalled their advance with a frag. Hammer however was able to dispatch the targets, in the end using frags and flashbangs. Hammer cleared the room and discovered a hole leading to a tunnel with twists and turns. Medics tended to the injured assaulters.

Hammer 0-1 made the call to clear the tunnel and pursue the targets further and proceeded to do so without approval from Command. Hammer 0-1 also requested that Stake establish a new cordon around the tunnel entrance inside of the building.

Hammer 2 was selected as the entry team. Hammer 2 made a flash & frag entry and led the assault force in clearing the tunnel. Flashbangs were utilized at corners to precede the assault force throughout the tunnel.

Clearing the tunnel took 7 minutes and 37 seconds due to several traps and proceeded without incident. At the end of the tunnel, Hammer 2-6 sighted a ladder going upwards, presumably connecting to a building. Hammer 2 searched the top of the ladder before clearing the first room in the building - a parking garage bathroom, without incident. The terrorists were not seen anywhere in the parking garage.

Hammer 0-1 made the recommendation for ISR to look at footage leading up to their entry. After coordinating with Command and using IZLID, the address of the house was pinpointed and ISR could now look there. Command ordered Hammer to proceed back aboveground on foot and finish SSE while standing by for exfil. After going back on foot and finishing SSE Hammer, Stake, and Check moved to exfil.

**Addendum Note:** After the raid Hammer 0-1 was reprimanded for acting without approval in clearing the tunnel and pursuing the targets further.

**Foreword:** After extorting information from local civilians, the location of the remnants was pinpointed. MTF Iota-10 masquerading as Russian internal troops cleared the area of any civilians. Platoons Charlie and Golf of MTF Upsilon-6 proceeded on to the safehouse and began the operation there. The following video log is recorded from Hammer 1-1’s body camera and microphone.
-----

**<TRANSCRIPT BEGINS>**

**RADIO:** "Hammer 0-1, Anvil 0-1, this is Command. You are Echo, how copy?"

**RADIO:** "Command, this is Hammer 0-1. Copy Echo. Out.”

**RADIO:** "Command, this is Anvil 0-1. Copy Echo. Out.”

**HAMMER 0-1:** “Hammer, move to entry. Stack up."

//The squad quickly moves into their positions against a wall of glass; the room inside is visible, a typical corporate workspace with six wooden desks and computers. On the right wall, there is a large storage cabinet and at the end of the room is a door.//

**HAMMER 0-1:** “Hammer, consummate.”

//The rifle stocks of Hammer smack against the wall, shattering it. Hammer and Anvil quickly move into the room and clear it.//

**HAMMER 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1-2, 1-1:** “Clear.”

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Door up front, taking the door.”

**HAMMER 1-4, 1-3, 2-6, 2-5, 2-4:** “With you.”

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Flash out.”

//Hammer 1-5 primes a flashbang, opens the door and tosses it. He closes the door quickly after.//

//Sound of flashbang bouncing and detonating.//

//Hammer 1-5 opens the door with Hammer 1-4 behind him. They move left, with Hammer 2-6 and Hammer 2-5 moving right.//

//Remnants from the two doors on the left end of the corridor begin firing at Hammer 1-5. The bullets are stopped by his ballistic shield.//

//Hammer 1-4 provides cover fire. Hammer 1-3 fires a burst of rounds towards the remnant at the left door, injuring him.//

//The remnant on the right door fires at them, but injures nobody. They close the door, and window glass can be heard breaking.//

//The rest of Hammer and Anvil move into the corridor.//

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Taking first door from entry.”

**HAMMER 1-1:** “Hammer 1 with you.”

//Hammer 1 moves into position around the door. Hammer 1-5 opens the door with a creak, and they quickly move in. The room inside appears to have a canvas stand, paints, and censored instances of SCP-6160 on the walls.//

**HAMMER 1-5, 1-4, 1-3, 1-2, 1-1:** “Clear.”

[AUDITORY COGNITOHAZARD REDACTED]

//Hammer 1-4 and Hammer 1-2 take off their SCRAMBLE headgear. Sporadic gunfire is heard from outside the room.//

**RADIO:** "Hammer 1-1, this is Command. Be warned, auditory cognitohazard present. We’re working on getting a filter up. Over.”

//Hammer 1-2 stares at the instances of SCP-6160 on the walls, while Hammer 1-4 glances at the instances before turning and raising his firearm towards the rest of Hammer. An explosion from outside the room is heard, momentarily interrupting Hammer 1-4.//

//Hammer 1-1 raises his firearm and shoots Hammer 1-4 and Hammer 1-2 in the head. They drop to the ground, dead.//

**RADIO:** “Command, this is Hammer 1-1. Copy, eliminated Hammer 1-4 and Hammer 1-2 as they were compromised. Over.”

**HAMMER 1-1:** “Carry on.”

//The auditory cognitohazard ceases to be heard due to the new filter.//

//Hammer 1 moves out of the room, rejoining the others in the corridor. Smoke is seen exiting from the left doorway on the left end of the corridor due to the earlier explosion.//

**HAMMER 1-1:** “Hammer 1 standing watch.”

//Soon after, the rest of Anvil and Hammer finish clearing, and the force proceeds towards the leftward end, where there is a turn to another corridor.//

//As the force approaches the corridor, a remnant in the window separating the rightward room and the next corridor is seen. The remnant begins to fire at the force through the window and the right doorway.//

//Anvil 1-3 and 1-4 are injured from the gunfire and fall back. Hammer and Anvil are unable to dispatch the remnant with gunfire.//

**ANVIL 2-5:** “Frag out.”

//ANVIL 2-5 primes a frag and she throws it into the next corridor in quick succession. The frag detonates and the remnant drops to the ground dead.//

**ANVIL 1-6:** “On point.”

**ANVIL 2-6:** “On point.”

//Anvil 1-5 and 2-6 turn the corner.//

**ANVIL 2-6:** “Junction, windows on left and right.”

//The rest of the force turn the corridor and follow Anvil 1-5 and 2-6, revealing a corridor with two windows on both opposite walls leading to a four-way intersection, peppered in holes from the frag and the corpse of a remnant with a pool of blood around it.//

//The left and right corridors connecting to the junction are empty, while there is a short corridor connecting to a large space upfront. There is a door on the right wall of the corridor. The left wall is part of a glass wall separating the corridor, space, and conference room.//

//Anvil 1-5 slowly enters the space.//

**ANVIL 1-5:** “Machinegun nest!”

//Anvil 1-5 quickly retreats from the space back into the corridor.//

//Anvil 1 begins to exchange gunfire and grenades with the nest sporadically. Anvil 2 enters the left corridor connected to the junction.//

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Taking corridor right.”

**HAMMER 0-1:** “Hammer with you.”

**HAMMER 2-6:** “On point.”

//Hammer follows 1-5 and 2-6 into the corridor. The right corridor is a slope downwards, connecting to a large space, assumed to be the reception of the building in the floor plan.//

//The left wall of the corridor ends halfway through, and there is a ramp overlooking the reception. Hammer 1-5 peeks out the wall, seeing a group of roughly ten remnants running towards a large doorway in the middle of the front wall of the reception.//

//Hammer moves quickly downwards, firing at the remnants. Several of them drop to the floor either injured or dead; Kiril Avilov is seen among them. The rest of them put their hands up in the air, including a Marlen Avilov.//

//Once at the floor, Hammer moves to restrain the remnants that surrendered. Hammer 2 stands watch with Hammer 0-1. On the opposite end of the reception, there is a ramp leading to another corridor, presumed to lead to the machinegun nest.//

//Hammer 1 moves quickly towards the ramp.//

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Flash out.”

//Hammer 1-5 primes a flashbang before tossing it up into the corridor, and it detonates. Swiftly, the team makes their way up to the corridor and fire upon those that are manning the machinegun nest, disabling it.//

//Hammer 1 enters the space beyond the nest and begins clearing; the space is a large workspace with eight desks, computers, and multiple rooms adjacent.//

**HAMMER 1-5, 1-3, 1-1:** “Clear.”

**HAMMER 1-5:** “Taking door opposite nest.”

**ANVIL 1-6:** “Coming out.”

//Anvil 1 and 2 enter the workspace after clearing other rooms.//

**HAMMER 1-3:** “With you.”

**HAMMER 1-1:** “With you.”

//The door appears to have a paper sign taped on to it, saying: “BATHROOM OUT OF ORDER.” in Russian. They move into position around the door and Hammer 1-5 slowly opens the door.//

//Upon opening the door, water leaks out of the bathroom and stains the carpeted floor. Hammer 1-5 and 1-3 cough from the stench emanating from the bathroom, which has the floor covered in a thin layer of water.//

//In the bathroom there appears to be a hole on the toilet flange, covered in dried and wet feces.//

**HAMMER 1-5:** //weakly// “Clear. Looks like the drainpipe burst.”

//Hammer 1-5 closes the door, and Hammer proceeds down to the reception with Anvil. At the reception, they see Hammer 2-6 firing through the windowed doors into a lobby, where there appears to be a machinegun nest. The force has positioned itself out of the line of sight of the nest.//

**HAMMER 2-6:** “Thermobaric out!”

//Hammer 2-6 primes and tosses a thermobaric grenade into the lobby, and runs to cover. The grenade detonates with a loud blast and a visible fireball. All windows near the lobby break, and thick smoke emanates out of the lobby after the detonation.//

//Hammer and Anvil regroup in the reception, awaiting further orders.//

**HAMMER 0-1:** “Let’s finish SSE before moving to exfil.”

**Addendum Note:** Hammer 1-1, 1-3 and 1-5 were unaffected by the auditory cognitohazard due to their CRV[[footnote]] Cognitive Resistance Value [[/footnote]] being high enough that the cognitohazard had no effect.

**Addendum Note:** Following the raid, the instances of SCP-6160-1 at Dneprovskoye were neutralized, and any additional instances of SCP-6160 were destroyed. SCP-6160 was placed into containment at Site 77, where it is now. The rest of the documentation relating to SCP-6160 was recovered from this raid, and with the remnants apprehended, effective inoculation could now be used against SCP-6160. The investigation concluded after, and the SCP was reclassified as Safe.

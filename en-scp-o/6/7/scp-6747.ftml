# One Daumal is equal to the average topological complexity of narrative-space-time in 1-1-1-space (ie. a space possessing exactly 1 narrative dimension, 1 spatial dimension, 1 temporal dimension).
# Recent findings indicate that infokinetic interactions continue to occur at the quantum level, even in the vacancy of one or more dimensional categories. These interactions' net result tends toward an irrational value slightly greater than zero, often interpreted as [*/scp-3955 a set of musical pitches.]
# 1.5 narrative, 2 spatial, 1 temporal dimensions.
# **narrativohazard:** a construct of one or more independent narremes which collectively cause cascades impacting the structural integrity of relevant narratives.
# **##green|break the chains##**
# Semifictionality of known reality initially theorized by **Sr. Rsr. Emeritus S. A. Swann** and later proven by **Sr. Archivist Emeritus I. H. Pickman et. al**.
# Personnel are reminded that free will does not exist.
# To date, 8 types of imaginon particles have been formally discovered, corresponding to the 8-step abstraction of //**α**//.
# (antiquated: //Alpha-Narrative//)
# **protagonist:** an entity possessing above-average resting narrative potential ie. possessing local pataphysical topology greater than 2 (in local narra-space-time).
# **NOTE:** Antagonists are a form of protagonist framed in opposition to another protagonist, and their perceived antagonism is inherently subjective.
# **archetypical:** a character whose below-average narrative energy results in the tendency to conform to archetypes as required by local narrative structures.
# [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|Position vacant]]].
# The O4 Council: a quorum of ~100 Site Directors, Department Heads, and other **A-CLASS** personnel responsible for handling important situations that do not require the attention of **OVERSEER COUNCIL**. Due to the **ORACLE** (O5-9)'s vacancy following the conclusion of the Damien Nowak case, O4 Command functions as a tiebreaker for the oft-tied **O5 COUNCIL**.
# **##green|break the chains##**
# Member of the Site-120 Director Council; Director of the Spatial Disruptions Division of the Department of Ontokinetics; chosen as the [[span class="bigtext"]]SUMMIT LEAD[[/span]] due to his extensive knowledge regarding Ontokinetics and the nature of reality.
# **A-CLASS** personnel; Head of the Translation Department; oldest Foundation personnel (excluding [[span class="bigtext"]]##f24|OVERSEER##[[/span]] personnel).
# Member of the Site-120 Director Council; Director of the Theology Division of the Department of Ontokinetics.
# Member of the Site-120 Director Council; Director of the Thaumaturgy Division of the Department of Ontokinetics.
# Dr. Hannah Rivera and Dr. Raia Micheals, two deceased personnel responsible for [[[SCP-5292|Site-120's Founding in 1916]]].
# Such as the utilization of [[[SCP-963|consciousness-trapping items]]], [[[SCP-2718|quantum approximation]]],  [[[SCP-5572|natural phenomena]]], or [[[SCP-6936|thaumaturgic rituals]]].
# [[span class="bigtext"]]##green|HARVEST##[[/span]]
# Due to its prior high narrative energy and relative ease in obtaining detailed information regarding it, the subject chosen for the experiment was [[[critter-profile-sparky|Dir. Asheworth]]]'s prior dog.
# **##green|VESSEL##**
# Believed to be an artefact of Fictionalization Attempt A/13.
# The latter three personnel had no involvement in [[span class="bigtext"]]PROJECT X/MACHINA[[/span]] as they had each been retired from service decades prior. It is believed that they were constructed by SCP-6747-B and/or -C using latent memory structures stored within the former's hippocampus, as each had held senior executive positions for a plurality of Dir. King's research career; whether their mesofictional exaggeration is caused by cognitive data corruption or SCP-6747-A3's inherent properties remains unknown.

**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-6751 does not exist, containment is unnecessary.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]**Kušum:** Item's containment has been abandoned indefinitely.[[/span]]

**Description:** SCP-6751 is a two-story house in Victoria, Canada that does not exist. Though it can be both perceived and physically interacted with, thorough testing[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Including but not limited to: sonar, infrared, thermal, electromagnetic, thaumaturgic, and hume scanning.[[/span]] has determined that it is not within actuality. Public records report that SCP-6751 was built in 2007 by "Lacuna Construction and Repair", of which no other information has yet been uncovered.

SCP-6751 is currently inhabited by SCP-6751-A, a 38-year-old man named John Dome. Dome was interviewed in 2012 by Agent N. Nescio, who was disguised as a journalist that was writing profile pieces on average Victorian citizens. Most of the interview's footage and all relevant metadata is inaccessible due to severe data corruption, thanks to a flaw in the construction of Nescio's concealed body camera. The following log is of what little video and audio has been restored.

**SCP-6751-A:** --iving here for about... 7 years? I inherited it from my father when he passed.

**Nescio:** I'm sorry.

**SCP-6751-A:** //[Laughing.]// Don't be. He was a real sack of shit. Kicked me out of the house when I was 16 because he //[Finger quotes.]// "didn't agree with my lifestyle choices."

**SCP-6751-A:** I only got the house because he never got around to writing a will and nobody really knew what he would've wanted. Most of his things got dumped on me by def--

**Nescio:** --id you paint these?

**SCP-6751-A:** Yeah. I've always been a bit of an astronomy nut. I was one of those kids who was convinced he'd grow up to be an astronaut, y'know? Bought my own telescope and everything.

**SCP-6751-A:** 'Course, light pollution here is only getting worse by the year. So I figured I'd make my own stars.

**Nescio:** It's beautiful.

**SCP-6751-A:** Thanks-- but it doesn't even scratch the surface. Take a look at //this//.

**Nescio:** Have you ever painted them?

**SCP-6751-A:** That's the beauty of it-- I don't //need// to. They're already there. See?

//[SCP-6751-A takes several steps forward, pointing at the ceiling. Audio of his footsteps is delayed by 4.5 seconds. As Nescio appears to startle slightly when the footsteps become audible, it is possible that this delay is unrelated to the footage's corruption.]//

//[SCP-6751-A and Nescio stand in the second-floor hallway. The ceiling is not in frame. There is an open door to SCP-6751-A's left, through which a darkened bedroom is partially visible, and a closed door behind it, at the end of the hall. The natural light levels suggest that this takes place at least an hour after the first video's events.]//

//[For the duration of the video, nothing happens in the bedroom. SCP-6751-A and Nescio do not appear to notice it.]//

**Nescio:** --there?

**SCP-6751-A:** //[Gesturing towards the closed door without turning around.]// Stairs to the attic.

**Nescio:** //[Pause.]// You have an attic?

**SCP-6751-A:** Yeah. Though... I haven't been there since I was a kid.

**Nescio:** Is it unsafe?

**SCP-6751-A:** Nothing like that. //[SCP-6751-A pauses, shifting in place.]// My father told me he'd burn whatever I left behind when he kicked me out. If that had been a lie-- if had kept any of my things in storage...

//[Inactivity in the bedroom sharply increases.]//

**SCP-6751-A:** Well. It wouldn't mean much. But it would mean //something//.

**SCP-6751-A:** I was terrified of the dark when I was a kid, did you know that? Slept with a nightlight 'till I was halfway through college.

**SCP-6751-A:** Yeah, I know I don't look the type. But it's true. Something about the dark always makes my imagination go wild. I can't stop thinking about what could be in those lightless places, even when I know there's nothing there.

It is not known how the Foundation first became aware of SCP-6751 and its anomalous nature. There is no record of any individual named N. Nescio ever being in the Foundation's employ.

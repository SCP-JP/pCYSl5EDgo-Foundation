How long has it pursued you? It was… Since you first transferred in for that long-term research stay — to fill a spot left vacant.

You can't recall how you got //here//, but your last memory is from your bed. You lay there, paralyzed and alone, for the sixth night in a row. Your shirt stuck to your back with sweat. Each night before you, the site looked emptier, until you felt like the last person around.

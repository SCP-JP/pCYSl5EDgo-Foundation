**Item #:** SCP-5746

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5746 is contained via the existence of the Foundation. Site-∞ should be built around SCP-5746. SCP-5746 and SCP-5746-1 are self-repairing and need no outside maintenance. Only MTF-777 "The Crystal Ballers" are permitted to operate SCP-5746-1. Visual logs recorded from tests on SCP-5746-1 should be saved on Foundation Deepwell servers. Utilizing SCP-5746-1 to observe the past is forbidden and will result in amnestic treatment or permanent reassignment[[footnote]]See Visual Log.01 for more details.[[/footnote]].

**Description:** SCP-5746 is a temporal eigenmachine[[footnote]]An anomalous machine made with anomalous technology.[[/footnote]] disguised as an industrial factory in Cardiff, Wales. It has five sub-levels. Four body scanners are found on Sub-level 3; they are collectively designated SCP-5746-1.

Part of SCP-5746-1's anomalous abilities effect the human psyche and perception of time. When a subject is asleep and placed into a scanner, their psyche is sent through time. The brain presents this experience in metaphorical and surrealist imagery. This experience has been equated to astral projection[[footnote]]Astral projection (also known as astral travel), is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience (OBE). //Myers, Frederic W.H. (2014), "Astral Projection", Journal for Spiritual & Consciousness Studies, 37 (1): 52//[[/footnote]] into the astral plane[[footnote]]The astral plane, also called the astral realm or the astral world, is a plane of existence postulated by classical, medieval, oriental, and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. //Bruce, Robert, Astral Dynamics: A NEW Approach to Out-of-Body Experiences, 1999, ISBN 1-57174-143-7//[[/footnote]] by Foundation anthropologists and theologists.

Astral projection via dreams has allowed mystics of all backgrounds to receive, and recall, prophetic dreams. However, most of the information is lost in translation via human perception. Use of SCP-5746-1 has allowed for accurate data collection, including forecasts of future containment breaches.

++ Operator Instructions

A sapient humanoid subject scoring 42 APA [[footnote]]Astral Projection Ability[[/footnote]] or higher should be used as an operator candidate. Operators should be unconscious when placed inside an instance of SCP-5746-1. Input should be in "YYYY/MM/DD 0000:00:00 UTC Location Coordinates" format per scanner. Both departure and return must be programmed. Operators should be well versed in a mystical tradition, and must spend at least one hour in intense study of said tradition before use of SCP-5746-1. Total baseline time spent on the astral plane is 0.3 m/s.

**(Initial Test)**
**Date:** 1991/05/02 0823

**Operator:** Agent Ariadne "Eris" Géfyra

**Astral Experience:** Hades[[footnote]]The Greco-Roman underworld.[[/footnote]] and the River Styx[[footnote]]Considered to be the river that a soul must cross after death in Greco-Roman mythology[[/footnote]].

**Forecast:** The forecast was set for 12 hours in the future. After the operator crossed the river, visuals observed a Site-∞ fire drill occurring at 0230. Operator was outside the laboratories on Sub-Level 2 and Researcher Joseph Królik was alone at the time of the drill. In his exhaustion, he fell five floors while ascending the fire escape and died from his injuries.

**Note:** Operator was unable to physically grab the researcher as he fell, and during Agent Eris' debriefing, Researcher Joseph Królik was placed under security watch for 14 hours. Researcher Davis requested that Researcher Królik sleep.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**Date:** 1995/05/02


What's the purpose of the astral plane? Why do the operators have to travel through it? I've noticed that each astral plane is experienced differently by the operator. Hypothetically, the astral plane reflects their theological and mystical background. Is there a single, unified astral plane?

If we send an operator to the past will my questions be answered? Or would we get more questions? I feel like the answer is "yes", or "42".

Unfortunately your request was denied. Director Tailor is worried about the creation of a paradox. I'd pursue this further if I wasn't busy administrating other projects and dealing with the twins. I'm sorry Davis but you'll have to leave this proposal alone.

We're only able to observe events. No operator has been able to directly interact with their environment. I'm not sure what Director Tailor's motives actually are, because I feel this isn't just about paradoxes. Can we work on getting Proposal Hindsight passed?

**0252:** Researcher Davis enters the main operational and observational platform attached to SCP-5746-1's containment chamber. He opens a small container from his coat and consumes something from inside.

**0301:** He turns on the machine and runs to SCP-5746-1's containment chamber. He stumbles as he removes his clothes revealing an operator body suit.

**0306:** Yawning, he inputs the coordinates into the scanner. The computer yields an error. Site-∞'s security alarms trigger at this point. Davis frantically types away at the keyboard.

**0308:** The computer stops yielding an error. Davis fist pumps before he lays down on a gurney and appears to pass out.

**0309:** Automation takes over, and Davis is rolled into the scanner.

**0310:** There is a bright white flash. Video cuts.

//**Summary:** Researcher Davis initiated an unauthorized test on SCP-5746-1.//

//[Video feed starts on the night sky. There is a small, blue-white neutron star focused in the frame. It spins, and grows. In a few seconds it dominates the frame. Grunting is heard off screen as the center of the star collapses into a blackhole. The grunting turns into screams. Feed cuts for approximately five seconds.]//

//[Feed starts again in blackness. Researcher Davis lifts his head from a desk, revealing him to be in his office. The office is lit by no discernible source of light. Lighting is blue-white and dim.]//

**Davis:** Wha- wha- //(rubs eyes)// what happened? Did I fall asleep?

//[On the desk is a piece of paper with writing. The writing is illegible. Sitting next to the paper is a keycard.]//

**Davis:** Wait, //(picks up the paper)// what's this?

//[Davis mumbles to himself for a moment and then reads the contents out loud for the recording.]//

**Davis:** //(reading)// "You are not alone, so keep your smarts. There's a reason why the documentation for SCP-5746 explicitly states" //(takes a deep breath)// "__operators (subjects) must be well versed in a mystical tradition__."

**Davis:** "When you leave the office follow the signs to 'SCP-5746-1'. It's not where you're expecting it to be."

**Davis:** "Remember, on your way back leave to write this note to yourself. Don't come looking for me. If you think you see yourself, or something weird, ignore it and move on."

**Davis:** //(pauses)// "Signed... me."

**Davis:** //(folds up the letter and places it in his pocket)// Oh God what did I do...

//[Researcher Davis exits his office and enters the main office floor. There is no ceiling. The offices walls continue upward, fading into Space. A soft blue-grey light lights the room. There is no source for the light. Davis looks up and sees nebulae and supernovae stretch over the offices. Davis stumbles. He dry heaves and vomits.]//

**Davis:** Oh God //(groans)// I'm dizzy.

//[He stumbles away from his office and lays down. Heaving and sobbing are heard. After a few minutes, Davis calms himself and leaves the offices. The hallway walls also stretch into darkness. The soft lighting is the same as in the offices. Stars twinkle in the shadows above Davis.]//

**Davis:** //(whispers)// I've never had vertigo this bad.

//[He stumbles and uses the wall as a brace. Continuing on in silence for a few minutes, he reaches an intersection. There are signs on the wall; the text is illegible.]//

**Davis:** //(reads quietly)// "To SCP-5746-1".

//[The void above the hallway is denser with stars and supernovae.]//

**Davis:** //(glances up, winces)// This would be gorgeous if I wasn't terrified.

//[A yellow-white light behind Davis brightens. He turns around and sees yellow-white light coming from around the corner. Davis breathes heavily.]//

//[A low static hum is recorded.]//

**Davis:** Who is that?

//[He wipes sweat off his face, shakes his head and turns around. Wordlessly, Davis walks away from the light; continuing toward SCP-5746-1's containment chamber. He approaches another intersection and continues to follow the signs. Around the corner the ceiling is completely void of stars.]//

//[Davis breathes heavily but continues walking. After a few minutes pin-points of stars appear from behind the darkness. Davis passes what is hypothesized to be a dark absorption nebula. From behind the nebula a supernova dominates the frame. At the far end of the hallway are security doors to SCP-5746-1's operational room.]//

**Davis:** //(quietly)// What is this?

//[Every star appears to be an eye and focused directly on Researcher Davis. He remains in the shadow of the nebula.]//

**Davis:** //(clears his throat, takes a deep breath)// Hello! Can you understand me?

//[Visual and audio distorts. The colors of the frames split into cyan and magenta.// Kadosh, kadosh, kadosh[[footnote]]Transliterated from Hebrew, meaning "holy, holy, holy"[[/footnote]]. //can be heard distantly when audio is reversed. Feed cuts for a second, and on its return Davis is hunched over.]//

**Davis:** //(mumbling quietly)// Think of something else, don't perceive it. Think of my rat. Think of coffee. Think of Królik.

//[Davis picks himself up, there is the sound of paper falling. He rolls back his shoulders and strides through the anomaly's gaze.]//

**Davis:** //(softly)// Królik, I'll see you soon. We can take a break from research. //(breathes slowly)// We should go to a cafe. Maybe in a new town?

//[Visual remains nominal. Eyes continue to focus on Researcher Davis.]//

//[He continues to whisper and mumble to himself, until he reaches the end of the hallway. He uses the keycard and hastily enters the room. Hunching over, he vomits.]//

**UNKNOWN:** Ah dude! Someone's going to have to clean that up!

//[Davis looks up at a security guard's booth in front of SCP-5746-1's containment chamber.]//

**Davis:** //(groans)// I'm sorry.

**Security Guard:** Yea, whatever. I'm going to be cleaning that up. //(sets down a Nintendo 64 controller. The CRT screen is paused on Donkey Kong 64)// What do you want?

**Davis:** I'm here to observe the birth of the universe.

**Security Guard:** Do you have Double-Silver Clearance?

**Davis:** //(pulls the keycard from his pocket)// This it? //(hands it to the guard)//

//[The security guard takes the card and places it under its desk. It taps a button from under its desk, and the doors to SCP-5746-1's containment opens. White light shines through the doorway. Davis takes a step inside. Everything is static. He stands on nothingness. The static engulfs the feed for a few minutes.]//

//[Feed returns to darkness. Davis looks around; a point of light is spotted in the distance. He wordlessly heads in the direction of the light. As he approaches it, the space around him transforms into SCP-5746-1's containment chamber. A tall figure is hunched over an open panel for one of the scanners. Feed turns black for a few seconds. Davis backs away from the tall figure.]//

**Davis:** I know you from somewhere! Where do I know you?

//[Visual is static.]//

**Davis:** How do I know you?

**UNKNOWN:** I should've expected you would've perform this test. Now I have to weave everything back together.

**Davis:** What are you talking about? Test? Who are you?

**UNKNOWN:** //(laughs)// Did you know the universe and the astral plane are actually many, many, many tachyon threads woven into a five-dimensional tapestry. 

**UNKNOWN:** This will take me millennia to weave back together. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-stitch-in-time-saved-mine Again.]

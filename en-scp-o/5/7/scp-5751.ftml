**Special Containment Procedures:** To contain SCP-5751, the Foundation would need to secure all instances of optical storage media worldwide and halt their further production. As such action would represent an enormous expenditure of funds and manpower, and attract considerable media attention, this approach is not presently under consideration.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] Cernunnos-class objects can be contained by the Foundation, but the measures required to do so are impractical.[[/span]]

In the event that solid-state media entirely replaces optical storage media, SCP-5751 may require reclassification. Until that point, except in cases relating to Foundation interests, minimal effort to acquire SCP-5751 instances will be made. A modest budget line exists for the purchase of storage media collections when necessary; collections held as evidence by law enforcement agencies should be acquired via impersonation of higher-level authorities or inter-agency cooperation (where possible).

Instances of SCP-5751 are archived in High-Yield Data Storage Facility 4 at [http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43].

----

**Description:** SCP-5751 is the phenomenon of additional items appearing in collections of disc-based storage media after their owner's death. The first SCP-5751 instances were 8-inch 'floppy' disks. The anomaly has since spread to 5¼-inch and 3½-inch disks, fixed disks, Zip disks, compact discs (CD-ROM), digital versatile discs (DVD), MiniDiscs, MiniDVD, LaserDiscs and Blu-Ray discs.

[[include component:image-block
    name=Disk.jpg|
    caption=SCP-5751-305.|
    width=290px|
   align=left|
]]

Upon the death of an individual possessing a disc collection numbering twenty items or more, there is a high probability that an SCP-5751 instance will manifest within it. The instance will contain sensitive digital information pertaining to the collection's owner; this can include images, documents, videos, and application-specific files. These files are not created by the anomaly, but rather restored; they were deleted or destroyed by the collection's owner at some point during their lives.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]See database entries for SCP-5751-1 and SCP-5751-5958 below for the evidence behind this assertion.[[/span]] The discs themselves are created by the anomaly, though they closely mimic other items in the same collection — to the point of matching their physical condition, such that instances originating outside of the Foundation often feature crude 'repairs' attempted by their discoverers to make them machine-readable.

Every file on an instance of SCP-5751 carries negative moral or legal implications about its former owner. Pornography is common, particularly illegal varieties. Textual, photographic or video evidence of wrongdoing, internet browser histories suggesting antisocial proclivities or pursuits, and information stolen from other individuals are also common. In most cases the existence of SCP-5751 instances comes to Foundation attention when unusual revelations about the personal lives of celebrities or criminals occur immediately after their deaths.

**Description:** Nineteen VISUS brand 5¼-inch floppy disks, each containing a single image file with lossy DCT compression. Each image depicts one of nineteen mutilated corpses.

**Notes:** In 1979 Albanian filmmaker B. Prifti released //The Wounded,// a graphic horror film suspected to contain 'snuff' elements. The low lighting and lack of cast information precluded his arrest until 1980, when he suffered a heart attack after a drug overdose and was dead for three minutes before resuscitation. Police secured a search warrant for his apartment, hoping to find drug paraphernalia; they instead discovered the floppy disks, which contained images of the murdered actors of sufficient resolution for their identification. This evidence led to Prifti's execution in 1982.

**Description:** One VISUS brand 3 1/4" floppy disk, in poor condition due to inferior late-model materials. The disk contains a small portion of a previously-unknown early build of Portico 1.0, the operating system coded by software pioneer Mark Post which made his company a household name.

**Notes:** After Post's death, the disk was discovered by his biographer who sold it to a reporter for the //New York Times.// Software analysis revealed that the code still contained comments from software engineers at Ananasoft Inc., indicating that it was actually plagiarized from the competing ANANASYS Cayenne operating system. Post was subsequently excised from his company's promotional material.

**Description:** One non-rewritable Blu-Ray disc containing unreported incidents from Foundation agent C. McDevitt's pre-employment history.

**Notes:** Agent McDevitt and four other agents were working as moles within three separate cells of the [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5512 Second Haptic Assembly] group of interest. The appearance of a disc in her personal collection alerted her MTF commander to her death, and three of the four remaining agents were successfully extracted before their covers were also blown.

**Description:** N/A

**Notes:** Five members of the Church of the Broken God, who had been acting as informants for the Foundation, were uncovered as traitors in early October 2020. They were able to escape to a safehouse in St. Petersburg to await extraction. Highest Priest Robert Bumaro confronted the O5 council and demanded proof that the Foundation was uninvolved.  The agents were disavowed by the council and killed via airstrike, to preserve the tenuous truce between the two organizations. Disc collections had been prepared in advance to cover this eventuality; no new discs appeared, however.

**Description:** One hard disk drive containing 500GB of pornography images and video with metadata from thirty-four different personal computers, and one address book.

**Notes:** Leipzig police executed a search warrant in 2009 against computer technician O. Lewandowski, on suspicion that he was acting as a broker for child pornography. All hard disk drives in Lewandowski's home were found to have been wiped clean, via magnetization. A second search warrant was issued after his death in 2020, whereupon a drive was found containing the aforementioned files. Information from the metadata and address book was used to bring forty-seven of Lewandowski's suppliers and customers to trial.

**Description:** Five non-rewritable Blu-Ray discs containing Foundation data files.

**Notes:** In late 2020 the Church of Maxwellism issued an ultimatum to the Foundation, demanding all information pertaining to SCP-5751. When this ultimatum was refused, Maxwellist operatives breached the security perimeter of Site-43 and successfully entered the underground facility. Dr. D. Sokolsky deleted all SCP-5751 data, which he had already condensed into five large files along with his detailed notes on the anomaly's practical applications. The demoralized Maxwellists were defeated, captured, and interrogated. They referred to SCP-5751 as "WAN's Leveller," a manifestation of their fragmented electronic god's sense of justice. Further investigation is pending the recovery of the files.

**Update:** Following a series of voluntary medical procedures conducted on Dr. Sokolsky in late December of 2020, the missing data was recovered.

Daniel,

I think it's time to take this to the next level, but Sophia won't answer my emails. I'm therefore moving the SCP-5751 dossier into the [http://www.scpwiki.com/resurrection-old-foes-hub Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority]'s portfolio. In my capacity as a deputy director of ETTRA, I propose the following research questions:

1) Is 5751 really a fragment of WAN?

2) Does it only activate when PEOPLE die? What if we assigned a disc collection to an animal? What if we assigned a disc collection to an ORGANIZATION?

3) If we could acquire disc collections from people in unstable alternate timelines, would the new discs generate upon timeline collapse? Would that count as 'death' for 5751's purposes?

4) What if instead of securing all disc media collections, we forced everyone to have one? Everyone, in the world? Would that mean most K-class scenarios would now generate a massive archive on the combined atrocities committed by mankind?

I am formally requesting access to the D-Class personnel pool.

- Dr. D. Sokolsky, Site-43

Daniil,

I think it's time for you to take a vacation.

1) How would you test this?

2) Why would we want to know what awful things our cats have done?

3) Are you suggesting we use the deaths of entire universes as fact-finding missions? Or are you suggesting we //cause// the deaths of entire universes //for// fact-finding missions? The distinction is important to me.

4) HOW WOULD YOU TEST THIS.

I am formally ordering you to get a medical checkup. I'm not 100% sure they properly restarted your heart last week.

- Dr. Dan, ETTRA Command, Area-09

P.S. What about using a disc collection with a specific weight as a dead man's switch? Or making up a new format out of rare, esoteric, or even thaumaturgical materials, and using the anomaly to duplicate them? Or...

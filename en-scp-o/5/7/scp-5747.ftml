This is my gift for [[*user topdownunder]]. Hey, top! I made a story with your magic metal! I have no idea why I included so many drones. Spoilers for the end: [[span class="dblock"]]Jeff Bezos unnaturally removes the Hephaesium, but does so successfully, whilst retaining its abilities. Jeff Bezos doesn't know at all of the life-giving quality of Hephaesium, and only wants it for the endurance. Now, these delivery drones act as severed parts of SCP-5747, returning to it, and giving it the power it needs to rise. Turns out, SCP-5747 is just this huge, Hephaesium mech that someone couldn't/forgot to finish. That's why the cave temp was so high.[[/span]]

**Item #:** SCP-5747

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** The forest area surrounding SCP-5747 has been purchased by the Foundation, and been made to appear as a wildlife sanctuary zone. Two armed Foundation guards are to be monitoring the level-ground entrance of SCP-5747. Model B-10A[[footnote]]Semi-sentient micro drones with a set path. These drones have been altered to withstand extreme heat.[[/footnote]] micro security drones are to survey the inside of SCP-5747 to detect intruders/unexpected anomalies. Foundation researchers requesting entrance to SCP-5747 require a level 3 clearance, a heat endurance suit, and briefing from MTF Epsilon-09. Instances of SCP-5747-2 are to be stored in standard anomalous storage lockers when discovered.

**Description:** SCP-5747 is a vast underground cave in Greece. SCP-5747 is a spatial anomaly, taking up more space than it might seem from the outside. Temperatures taken thus far have been shown to exceed 150 degrees Celcius. The interior of SCP-5747 is covered with thin layers of SCP-5747-1.


[[include component:image-block name= http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/three-titans/CAVE |caption= //SCP-5747 after Foundation acquisition. (Underground entrance.)//|width=500px|align=center]]

SCP-5747-1 is a metal alloy by the name of //Hephaesium//.[[footnote]]Hephaesium is a metal alloy composed of multiple parts. Such as iron and beryllium bronze. Many elements found within Hephaesium are unknown. Hephaesium is used to build animate structures. One notable inclusion of Hephaesium is in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-359 SCP-359].[[/footnote]] It is not currently known how SCP-5747-1 was created at this quantity and spread on SCP-5747's interior.

SCP-5747-2 are massive build-ups of SCP-5747-1, and are found to be suitable quantities to integrate into structures and other various items.

**Addendum 5747.1:** //Exploration and Discovery//

SCP-5747 was discovered after minor tremors were traced back to it, affecting the surrounding environment. While pursuing the anomaly with heat signature technology, it was quickly learned that regularly entering would not be possible. MTF Epsilon-9[[footnote]]A mobile task force specialized in combatting heat-related anomalies.[[/footnote]] was shortly contacted to continue exploration of SCP-5747.
@@ @@
MTF Epsilon-9 had suits fabricated from anomalous heat endurant material that could withstand such temperatures. This gear also included auxiliary cooling devices if the suits were ever compromised. As the entrance to SCP-5747 is deep inside a forest, MTF Epsilon-9 members were required to prepare before entry, and walk the rest of the distance, as the forest was too dense.

**Incident 5747.2:**

A week later, the Model B-10A drone resumed video feed. Presumably, it had known to preserve onboard power by staying powered off. When the coordinates of the location the drone had resumed its activities were being extracted, it was quickly discovered that they couldn't be discovered due to jamming.

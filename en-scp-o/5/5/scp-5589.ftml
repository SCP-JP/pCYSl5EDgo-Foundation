Over the course of the next several days, all witnesses to the event[[footnote]] Totaling to approximately 57 individuals.[[/footnote]] were detained and amnesticized. Containment personnel were unable to locate Veneer nor Hollis; their disappearances were later attributed to a fatal motor vehicle accident.

After one month of investigation producing no leads, SCP-5589 was presumed to be an isolated incident, and, following an internal vote by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-726-ex |Department of Inbound Object Processing]]], classified as Extranormal Event #AXZ28D-B. 

**Addendum:** SCP-5589 was flagged for further research potential on July 24th, 2021, after the interception of an unusual package sent to the home of Site-88[[footnote]] A biological research facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.[[/footnote]] Director George Ramirez. Ramirez was previously aware of SCP-5589, having overseen its classification as an extranormal event while serving as a member of RAISA, and had more recently supervised the construction of a new wing of Site-88 dedicated to the containment of ranine and caecilian-like anomalies.

Upon opening, the package was found to contain only a single image, which has been attached to this document below.

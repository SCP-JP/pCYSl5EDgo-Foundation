**SCP-5562:** Shrewsbury Key
[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]

**Item No:** SCP-5562

**Containment Class:** Radix[[footnote]]Object has been incorporated into the Foundation's command structure, but is unrelated to Judaism.[[/footnote]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5562 is to be stored in Containment Chamber 12 at Site-26. Foundation knowledge of the existence of SCP-5562 is not to be disclosed to the British Occult Service.

Use of SCP-5562 requires the approval of the Site-26 Director or Overseer Command. The input of the Ethics Committee is to be disregarded.

**Description:** SCP-5562 is a large metal cube, measuring 3 metres tall, discovered beneath the town hall of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. SCP-5562 has 1 entrance, which can only be opened by an adult British citizen. How SCP-5562 verifies this is unknown.

A brass plaque is located to the right of the entrance, which reads "PROPERTY OF THE DIRECTORATE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, SECTIONS 13[[footnote]]Precursor of the British Occult Service during the First and Second World Wars.[[/footnote]] AND 19[[footnote]]Responsible for the interrogation of captured enemy soldiers during the Second World War.[[/footnote]]". A slot is located beneath this plaque.

Opening the entrance will result in the entrance automatically closing after a period of 20 seconds. Following this, the entrance will be unable to be opened for 50 seconds. Should an object have been present within SCP-5562, an envelope will be deposited from the slot. This envelope will contain all secret information contained within the inputted object.

No inputted objects have been present upon reopening SCP-5562.

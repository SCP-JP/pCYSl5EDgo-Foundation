++++ __Special Containment Procedures__:
Metatron.aic is to sweep police reports and civil complaints for any sign of an SCP-5698 manifestation.  Foundation agents are to amnesticize all individuals who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the anomaly after it has demanifested.  Pay records and bank accounts for affected individuals are to be artificially adjusted to conceal the effects of SCP-5698.

-----
++++ __Description__:
SCP-5698 is the designation for a migrating multi-faceted pocket reality housing a consumer goods warehouse.  The anomaly manifests as part of a pre-existing warehouse space, overwriting local baseline reality for the period of time the anomaly is present.  Employees of the business being overwritten are folded into the manifestation, appearing as custodians and workers within SCP-5698.   The manifestation can last anywhere from two days to a month.  No known pattern has been discerned for SCP-5698’s manifestations.

In these few instances where the property is abandoned, any individuals within one hundred meters of the manifestation at the time of its first appearance will be encoded as employees, regardless of their relationship with the property.  

It is unclear what happens to the products stored within the business that is overwritten by SCP-5698.  After a manifestation fades, the business returns to its normal appearance and the affected individuals are left with faint memories of their time as employees of the warehouse.

**__Discovery__**:
SCP-5698 was discovered on 31 March, 2014, when an abandoned warehouse in Creekside, Ohio[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Population is under five thousand individuals according to the 2010 United States Census.[[/span]] was taken over by the anomaly.  The property was less than thirty meters from the building that housed the local courthouse and Creekside City Hall.  All individuals working within this building were encoded into the rewriting of baseline reality to be employees of SCP-5698.  Mayor Maria Hoffman took on the role of shipping and receiving manager, and the Honorable Judge Jacob Fischer became the general manager of the property.  

On 2 April, 2014 police were called to the City Hall building as it was apparently abandoned and the reporting individual claimed the disappearance of the thirty-three county and city employees were due to “them damned Al-Qaeda hooligans.”  Creekside PD were called to the property housing SCP-5698 when Judge Fischer was observed in a short-sleeve button up shirt and wrinkled, grease-stained tie entering the building around 13:00 with a bag of fast food.

Individuals interviewed by Creekside PD were unaware that they had ever worked anywhere but SCP-5698.  

Embedded Foundation agents within the Ohio State Police received reports of this phenomenon and informed Site-43, which launched an investigation upon learning the specifics.  Police and witnesses were amnesticized.

**Wettle**: Someone told me you were the manager, that true?

**Hoffman**: I’m the shipping-and-receiving manager.  What’s it to you, pal?

//[Wettle makes a throat-clearing sound.]//

**Wettle**: I’ve been sent by the County to discuss your permits to operate such a building, and to inspect the premises.  Are you going to be a problem, Hoffman?

**Hoffman**: No, just I don’t know what you’d want to hear from me?

**Wettle**: Answers!

**Hoffman**: You haven’t asked me any questions yet.

**Wettle**: Good, you’re paying attention.  Okay so, what sort of business is this?

**Hoffman**: We’re the main distribution arm of the company.  So, we store products made by the company and make sure they get to the store shelves.  

**Wettle**: Alright, how long have you worked in this building?

**Hoffman**: Six years.

**Wettle**: Ever thought about running for political office?

**Hoffman**: Why would I do that when I have such a good job right here?

**Wettle**: What //is// your job, exactly?

**Hoffman**: I manage the shipping and receiving for the company from this location.

**Wettle**: Right, right.  Still no chance you’d run for office?

**Hoffman**: What is this?

**Wettle**: You don’t remember running for Mayor eighteen months ago and winning?

**Hoffman**: No! That’s ridiculous, I’ve been here this whole time.

**Wettle**: And //here//, being this warehouse.

**Hoffman**: Yes, where else?

**Wettle**: What’s so great about working here?

**Hoffman**: I work fifty hours a week, not a bit more.  I make $13.50 an hour, and they gave me this nifty shirt.  What’s not great?

**Wettle**: //[Muttering]// It’s not that nif–

**Hoffman**: Besides which, what else would I be doing?  Look Mr. County Officer, take a good look around town.  You see a lot of job opportunities?

**Wettle**: Right, so I talked with your shipping manager yester– 

**Fischer**: Shipping and receiving.

**Wettle**: Same difference.  So, you planning on being more cooperative?

**Fischer**: Everyone who works for the company is here to help.  It’s right there in our slogan!

**Wettle**: Great.  Turn down the pithy energy, please. 

**Fischer**: Well, friend, you’re not the most pleasant person I’ve talked to in a while.  You said you worked for the County?

**Wettle**: I did.  Okay, so how long have you worked in this warehouse?

**Fischer**: Twenty years.

**Wettle**: Did you go to college before that?

**Fischer**: God, no.

**Wettle**: So, you didn’t graduate from law school twenty-eight years ago?

**Fischer**: //[laughs]// If I went to law school, you think I’d work as a manager in a warehouse?  Even one as nice as this?

**Wettle**: Alright, forget I asked.  //[muttering]// Ridiculous.  

**Fischer**: Yeah, I’m lucky I got this job when I did.  Right before I got this job, I was working at the tire factory, the whole town did.  But it shut down, company moved it overseas.  And suddenly, everyone in town is lucky to get unemployment benefits.  After a while, people were moving away just to get dishwasher jobs.  If the company hadn’t opened up this warehouse, I’m afraid I’d be homeless or worse.

**Wettle**: So, you usually keep your employees working overtime?

**Fischer**: What’s needed is what’s done, that’s the way it is with us.  Besides, don’t force no one to stay late.

**Wettle**: But it’s not like they’re making all that much, so why would they if they didn’t have to?

**Fischer**: The company pays competitively, don’t be like that.  They’re certainly making more than if they didn’t have these jobs, right?

**Wettle**: You at least pay the federally mandated overtime amount?

**Fischer**: No one is working overtime, technically.

**Wettle**: What? Hoffman said she works fifty hours a week!

**Fischer**: Sure, and she does.  But everyone’s salary here. We work until the job is done.

//[Researcher Wettle makes a sound typically considered to be one of disgust.]//

**Fischer**: You got a problem, buddy?

**Wettle**: You got a funny attitude towards your employees’ benefits.  

**Fischer**: Oh, they don’t get benefits.  The company figured with Obamacare, they didn’t need to.

**Wettle**: //[Sighs.]// Alright, I’ll make a note of that.

– Aftereffects of Anomaly – 
[[/=]]
Individuals directly affected by SCP-5698, those folded into a local reality re-write and who perform as employees of the anomaly, have residual pervasive effects upon their personality.  For example, individuals universally have more aggressive tones in their interactions with others and exhibit rough, even unprofessional language no matter what their background.  Although they only retain partial, incomplete memories of their time as employees at SCP-5698, the experience often has a protracted effect on the subject’s priorities.

**Markam**: I’m sorry, Mayor, I don’t think I understand?

**Hoffman**: Jesus, Jill, it’s freaking obvious.  

//[All three City Council members share significant looks but don’t say anything.]//

**Hoffman**: If these companies aren’t going to make sure that their employees have medical and other benefits, I think we should open up a city-run clinic and food bank!  Our people deserve the care, goddamn it.

**Valencia**: Obviously, that would be a noble effort but where would we get the money?  

**Hoffman**: Government grants, raise business taxes, do what we have to actually serve the people in need.  I didn’t become mayor to leave the people that elected me high and dry.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Mayor Hoffman actually was elected on a “business first” platform.[[/span]]  

**Gerber**: Mayor, I’ve got to say, your passion for our constituents is commendable… I will remind you that we are being recorded, as is the case with all City Council meetings.  Couldn’t you show a little decorum?

**Hoffman**: If it means letting people go without care or enough food to eat because they’re paid like garbage, then [REDACTED] that.

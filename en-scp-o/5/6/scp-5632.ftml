**Special Containment Procedures:** All instances of SCP-5632 are currently contained in a Type-C Containment Aquarium Tank equipped with bulletproof glass, located in Wing B of Site-22. Only one instance should be withdrawn at a time, and only for study or healthcare purposes.

**Description:** SCP-5632 designates a previously unknown subspecies of //Pterois// fish[[footnote]] Also known as Lionfish [[/footnote]].

SCP-5632 does not present noticeably different physical characteristics from those of the fish of the //Scorpaeniformes// order; however, SCP-5632 instances are capable of causing small explosions to scare off predators, stun, and hunt down prey.

These explosions have been identified as similar to those resulting from detonating a plutonium bomb, but on a much smaller scale, as they present slight traces of ionizing radiation and electromagnetic pulses. SCP-5632's explosions do not present serious damage to human health, being only capable of causing injuries similar to those caused by bullet impacts; however, long exposure to said explosions can result in mild radiation poisoning symptoms.

Unlike common //Pterois// fish, SCP-5632 instances' dorsal stingers are not completely functional and cannot inject poison; instead, they store biological analogs of uranium and plutonium which are emptied after a few round of explosions. It is theorized that SCP-5632 instances are capable of synthesizing those components from the nutrients they consume, although the method by which they do it is not entirely clear[[footnote]] The presence of an unidentified organ near their gills has been detected and has been proposed as a possible responsible for this process. Testing on this is ongoing. [[/footnote]].

SCP-5632 was initially discovered in November 12th 2010 during the sinking of a commercial cargo, later identified as property of GoI-115 ("Radiosol"), near Isla de Sacrificios, Veracruz, México. The investigations undertaken in the area were not able to elucidate a specific reason for the sinking of the ship, although it was theorized that it could be the product of internal sabotage, non-anomalous failures of the vessel or [[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-096 DATA EXPUNGED]].

Naval Task Force Delta-8 ("Hellsinkers") and Mobile Task Force Rho-16 ("King Retrieves") were sent to the area to secure the recovered material and rescue possible survivors, respectively. 23 individuals were found near the cargo, later confirmed to be part of its crew, and, upon questioning, all the subjects claimed to have no knowledge of GoI-115 or the contents of the tanks on board as they were only on a common commercial voyage. Whether the SCP-5632 specimens were illegally entered or the members of the cargo were deliberately not informed of the delivery's content is still under discussion.

Numerous non-anomalous utensils, various documents, and multiple instances of SCP-5632 could also be recovered from the area. Once the cargo was fully inspected, searches were undertaken in the vicinity to capture more specimens of SCP-5632, which at the time were mistaken for non-anomalous lionfish that would be harmful to the environment.

SCP-5632's anomalous properties were not to be discovered until shortly after their temporary transfer to Site-22, during which time they began to cause multiple detonations for the purpose of attacking members of both Task Forces and breaking free from their containers. Seven members from Delta-8 and twelve from Rho-16 were injured, but were able to succesfully deliver all the instances to the Site.

Kind regards, Mr. Villarreal.

I am the current leader of Ambrose Restaurants, a major restaurant chain operating in Europe, and, well, we were wondering if you could help us.

You see, we've been getting rumors about [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-097 entities previously modified by you] and we've been curious to bring those biological wonders to our restaurant plates.

As we have lately been related to the sale and consumption of seafood, we wondered if we could ask you to create modified specimens of some species of exotic fish that was related in some way to nuclear energy, but without being harmful to the consumer, for course. If it's a popular plate in the region of México, all the better.

Along with this letter we will send you a blank check so that you can put the amount you want to receive in exchange for your service.

We look forward to your response, Mr. Villarreal.

@@ @@

I am the current leader of the Radiosol company, which you contacted not long ago, and I would like to talk with you about the little deal you made with the Manager of the Bioengineering Department.

I don't know if you know it, but this such "nuclear energy" is a very powerful force, called Tlanextlitetl, not to be trifled with or taken lightly, and it is a sacred symbol of my people. I therefore consider that his request to Mr. Villarreal is a little bit disrespectful, and I do not see how he has agreed to make the deal with you without asking me first.

You see, I do not agree with the idea of using Tlanextlitetl as a culinary ingredient or as a condiment for those beings who have been blessed with the gift of possessing that strength; instead, I believe that such animals should be treated with respect, just as any other living being deserves.

Although the deal has been agreed without my consent, I will not deny it either as long as they make sure to treat them at least respectfully. Therefore, I would like to ask you to cancel all culinary events that are related to the cooking and preparation of the specimens that you have received from us.

In case you wish to ignore this letter, I advise you that you should not tempt the most powerful Flame of all in that way.

We will impatiently await your response, Mr. Ambrose, and we hope you will not ignore the warnings.

Sincerely:

Kind regards, Ms. Bárbara.

I am afraid that we will not be able to fulfill your request, since a single event has already been organized in which the consumption of the fish that were kindly sent by your corporation was involved. As an apology, we are sending you 40% of the earnings from the initial event (£ 6,400,000) along with this letter and a chart in which you can choose any plate to be delivered to you as soon as possible.

Again, we are very sorry to have accidentally offended your people, and we offer to repair any possible moral damage that may have resulted

[[size 300%]]**{{G}}**[[/size]]reetings, Mr. Ambrose.

I would like to apologize for the aggressive tone of the previous letter. I am ashamed to have behaved that way with you.

I have had a talk with some Radiosol managers, who have helped me to understand that, after all, the consumption of powerful animals is not a serious offense to the moral of my people, as I believed, and in fact animals have been used in certain disputes, the use of which is considerably less ethical than your use.

Also, I would like to sincerely thank you for considering and choosing my company's bioengineering services, as we have been receiving additional bioengineering requests from third parties since the banquet date, I assume influenced by you. As a way to compensate for the lack of respect that I may have shown you, I will prepare and send you a second freighter with similar specimens, so you can organize a second event.

Thanks for trusting us, Mr. Ambrose. We look forward to keep working together for a long time.

Truly yours:

P.S: Remember not to keep multiple of those fish too close together or in very stressful environments, they get a bit unruly and when they "organize" they can be a real headache or something more serious than that.

[[/div]]

Since the sinking of the cargo, there have been sightings of people collecting non-anomalous lionfish, as well as an increase in the hunting of these animals suddenly. The reason for this is under investigation.

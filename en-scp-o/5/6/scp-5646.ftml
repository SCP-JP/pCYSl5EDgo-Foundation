<p><strong>Incident <span class="numba1">5</span><span class="numba2">6</span><span class="numba3">4</span><span class="numba4">6</span>-A:</strong></p>
<p>At approximately 9:45am on 10/28/1986, an individual identified as Level <span ID="clearance">3</span> Foundation Researcher Gene Halliburton was observed exiting from SCP-<span class="numba1">5</span><span class="numba2">6</span><span class="numba3">4</span><span class="numba4">6</span>. Researcher Halliburton was reported missing twelve days prior by an acquaintance, while hiking near Boynton Canyon, AZ, when a flash flood swept through his campsite and separated Halliburton from the rest of the group he was traveling with. He was presumed dead up until this point.</p>
<p>Researcher Halliburton was quickly detained and interrogated. An audio transcript of his testimony can be found below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Interview <span class="numba1">5</span><span class="numba2">6</span><span class="numba3">4</span><span class="numba4">6</span>-A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hane Dougherty, Head of Logistics and Foundation Asset Management for Site-<span ID="site3">64</span></p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Level <span ID="clearance2">3</span> Researcher Gene Halliburton</p>
<hr />
<p>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Well, Gene—Let me first say that I'm happy to see you are alive and seemingly healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> I feel fine—just don't see what all the fuss is about. You didn't need to bring out the whole cavalcade just for me.</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It's just standard procedure, nothing personal. Surely you must understand the—<em>gravitas</em>—of you showing up like this?</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Is this because of the sign? Look, I didn't realize it was a big issue, the phrasing is kind of confusing&#8230;I thought it led to the commissary—at least, it is the right direction. I would know, I've had to carry a compass just to get around here without being late to everything.</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> [pause]—Gene, are you aware of the events of the last few weeks?</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Wha—of course I am. If this is a comment about my mental acuity I'd remind you we are in a harassment-free workplace. It was my daughter's birthday. We went to the beach. I took a few days off and went to Vegas with the boys.</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> And what about Arizona? You must remember that.</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Yeah? What about it? It was a nice way to round off the trip. Weather was lovely. Got to see the vortex, which was almost certainly anomalous, by the way. We should probably look into that.</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> I guess so. Well, while you were gone, Logistics updated the keycard readers and issued new codes. The old ones stop working throughout the day, so I'll need to update yours immediately if you don't want to get flagged every time you do so much as wash your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Ah, I guess that explains things.</p>
<p><em>Some rustling is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Ah, perfect. Just be a sec.</p>
<p><em>A few seconds of silence, then a plastic sliding noise, followed by a series of out-of-key beeps.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Another sliding sound, more flat tones.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong>—Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It's probably this shoddy clearance goober. The handhelds have spotty connections down here. I'll get it done in a snap though, hold tight.</p>
<p><em>Scraping noise and creaking as a chair is pushed back. Dougherty is heard getting up and leaving the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> [sighs]</p>
<p><em>Roughly two minutes of silence pass.</em></p>
<p><em>The door is heard opening loudly, followed by a several pairs of footsteps.</em></p>
<p><strong>Security Personnel:</strong> Alright, let's go! Up! I SAID UP!</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> What the—?</p>
<p><em>Sounds of commotion, struggling.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong>—I'm a level <span ID="clearancespell">three</span>—[grunt]—fuck—LEVEL <span ID="clearancespellcap">THREE</span>! R&amp;D!—[groan]—</p>
<p><strong>Security Personnel:</strong> I don't care if you're the reanimated corpse of my mother! When I say let's go, you GO!</p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong>—But—agh—I-I didn't do anything! [sobs]—I <em>didn't</em>—<em>do anything</em>!</p>
<p><em>Thirty seconds of struggle, accompanied by a dragging sound.</em></p>
<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> H-HELP! Somebody help!—Please!—What are you going to do to me?—[sobs]—Let me go! I want to see my family! MAGGIE!—[sobs]</p>
<p><em>Microphone records similar for the next few minutes. The commotion steadily grows quiet, and someone still in the room shuts off the tape.</em></p>
<p>&lt;END LOG&gt;</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note: Subject continued to make frequent pleas to see his family until appropriate action was taken. Personnel dossier reveals no family by the names claimed by subject. Notably, the late Gene Halliburton had no children. The appearance of a Researcher Halliburton has been determined to be unrelated to his disappearance.</em></p>

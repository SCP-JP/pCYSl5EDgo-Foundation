**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5652 is to be contained in a petri dish filled with water at Site-228's aquatic wing. For feeding purposes, an //archaeon// (provided by the biological research facility) is to be placed into SCP-5652's petri dish daily.

**Description:** SCP-5652 is a microscopic entity resembling an adult female hammerhead shark[[footnote]]//Sphyrna mokarran// [[/footnote]] with an approximate 4 μm body length. Its intelligence appears to be higher than an average non-anomalous member of its species. SCP-5652's primary diet is composed of various microorganisms but it notably prefers //bacteria// and //archaea//.

Later during a medical examination, SCP-5652 was discovered and retrieved by the embedded Foundation agents, but the pain was still present.

Two days after SCP-5652's discovery, the source of the pain was found. 10 heavily damaged humanoid automatons of similar sizes to SCP-5652 were discovered embedded in the walls of Hemér's blood vessels. The automatons are noted to have disproportionally large hands.

Further research revealed that the automatons were remote-controlled and a small symbol depicting a modified version of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-hub|Foundation's sigil]]] was found printed on the chest of each automaton.

**Holding Measures:** SR #5674 may be manifested at Will by any good Christian. Conduits of SR #5674 found in the possession of the public are to be confiscated; if the offender is repentant, no further action will be necessary. The conduits are constituted of simple ordained matter and may be held at any reliquary or holding site within a locked box.

[[/footnote]] which can be accessed through the ritual use of a conduit to his Animus. An SR #5674 conduit is a sealable box forged from brass, of any dimensions, with a concave lens which allows a line of sight into its interior.

The conduit must be blessed in the name of Saint Hubertus—

+++++ **Addendum #5674.II— Providence at the XVI^^th^^ Crusade**

On the 2^^nd^^ day of April, 1.942 AD, after the Battle of Armagedōn as foretold in the Book of Revelation, the Synod of the Tridecimate ordained from the newly delivered Ierusalem a most righteous decree: **MYSTĒRIUM, King of Magog and Babylon the Great, Mother of Whores and Abominations on Earth, Profaned Karcist of Marrow and Apostle of the Son of the Morning**, would be brought before them, and, in his final acts, be rendered repentant by the Will of Our Ecumene. The Antichrist was disrobed, defanged and declawed, his eyes gouged, and, so cast before a  congregation of his enemies, was shot and baptised in fire. The Cult of Saint Hubertus sampled his residue, so that they may be granted Providence.

||~  ||~ Residue||~ Providence Granted ||~ Insight ||
|| 1^^st^^ || II; Writhing vestments of the **King of Magog** || Glass and metal towers with tops in the sky above streets with soulless people. The beaches and waterways of Mare Nostrum are dyed and polluted by refuse. Beasts of air and sea are choked by an iridescent black miasma which floats on the water. A cross inside a halo floats above the heads of the helpers of God's creatures. || Providence seems to resemble the 51^^st^^ Circle of Sheol. Residue was destroyed. ||
||4^^th^^ || II; The hearts, the 3^^rd^^ eye, the 13^^th^^ digit, and the womb of the **King of Magog**|| An orange mushroom growing from the ruins of a city. Iram of the Pillars reemerging to forge the Earth in her false clockwork image. Half-bodied golems in the sky crushing the citadels of Palaestīna under their fists. A cabal of smiling Daemons wearing the skins of men and the robes of bishops. Sol breaking through the Firmament and melting our flesh. Wormwood, the Leviathan of New Daevastan, blazing like a torch, regurgitating beasts and turning the seas blue and turbulent. || All attempts at misdirection. Residue was destroyed. ||
|| 8^^th^^ || I; The Crown of Tongues of the **King of Magog** || The Synod of the Tridecimate murdered by lead bullets. The bodies are placed in coffins draped under an unknown flag with three crescents. || Pathetic mockery. Residue was destroyed. ||
|| 16^^th^^ || I; Ashes of the **King of Magog** || @@    @@**[POTENTIAL HAZARD OF MIND PURGED]** **Proverbs 27:12**–  The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. || The Daemon blasphemes. ||
In the following days, the city of Ierusalem rejoiced, for it was scorched free of deceivers and tyrants and the abominable Larvae of Tartarus.

Three days after this Providence, to punctuate the Ceremonies of Resurrection Sunday, the Synod of the Tridecimate threw the ashes of the **King of Magog** into the Expanse beyond the Firmament, that he may never return. May all heathens learn humility from his grisly and deserved end.

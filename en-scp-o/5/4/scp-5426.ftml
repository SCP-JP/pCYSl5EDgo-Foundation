**Description:** SCP-5426 referred to a blog on the site 'www.tumblr.com' by the name of 'ValerieChocoHateBlog'. Valerie Choco is purportedly a character from the video game "Angels of Song", though no such character or franchise has been found to exist. SCP-5426 consists of posts expressing hatred for the aforementioned character. Posts range from simply stating hostility towards the character to in-depth analysis of the character and her backstory. Those who view SCP-5426 will begin to develop an intense hatred for Valerie Choco. They will also spontaneously become aware of the character's backstory and role within the supposed game, even when this information is not present on the blog. Initially no anomalous behavior was observed, until the character and franchise in question was found to be non existent.

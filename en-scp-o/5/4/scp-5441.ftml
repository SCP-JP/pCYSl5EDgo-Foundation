**INT. THE MAIN OFFICE**

The camera sweeps around the office, keeping in time with the upbeat folk-rock theme song that momentarily dominates the soundscape. We see Luke Milton at his desk, logging something on his computer. DAVE POOTS, his desk-mate, is aggressively applying Wite-Out to a filing card. He gives an awkward glare into the camera when he notices it has focused on him.

JANE BURTON, the receptionist, is answering a phone with one hand and playing with a Newton's Cradle with the other.

In the warehouse, MANDY SINGH is rifling through a locker of mundane-looking objects. She is startled by the camera, knocking a wooden owl ornament from the shelf. Deep red blood begins to pool around it on the floor, as Mandy shoos the camera out of the room.

In the office proper, Dave stands on a round stool to amend a sign: __DAYS SINCE LAST BREACH --__

Inside his personal office, SCOTT SULLY is asleep at his desk surrounded by toys and cheap trinkets.

The camera pans upwards, and comes to rest on a wall emblazoned with a large Foundation insignia. The music fades away.

We've got authorization to drop in a new player. Neither party shall be aware of the nature of SCP-5441. Consider this an exercise in narrative manipulation. The selected subject, however, has a background in the field which should cover for any... complications which may have arisen from the insertion of a less "genre-savvy" participant.

**Item #:** SCP-5441

**Object Class:** Keter

------

**Special Containment Procedures:** The file describing SCP-5441 has been contained within the digitalized teleplay for SCP-5441-43 ("Season 3 Episode 2 - The Intern").

MTF Theta-15 ("SILVERHAMMER") is to monitor the Site-67 anomaly at all times, placing the office under continuous covert surveillance and creating a new screenplay for each day's events.

Should subjects within SCP-5441 become aware of its anomalous nature, MTF Theta-15 has authorization to enforce the amnesticization of all affected personnel.
Minor suggestions that SCP-5441 may be anomalous are to be downplayed as paranoia or workplace pranks.
------

**Description:** SCP-5441 is a narrative anomaly combining 'pataphysical elements with those of a bureaucratic hazard.

First observed within the Foundation's Records Department, SCP-5441 has condensed the office ecosystem at Site-67 into a narrative structure similar to that of a "mockumentary"-style situation comedy. SCP-5441 is perceived as non-anomalous unless observed using audiovisual media, or transcribed in the form of a script or teleplay. It should be noted that in order for this to be effective, any references to the anomalous properties of SCP-5441 must make contextual sense within the narrative of a given "episode".

Subjects affected by SCP-5441 are observed to jump between locations via unknown means in a manner representative of scene changes. Much of the Records Department's productive output is believed to occur during these temporal lapses.

Subjects will often acknowledge or address the presence of a "camera" despite a film crew having never been observed within the premises. In most cases, however, the direct suggestion that a camera crew is present will be disregarded by subjects under the influence of SCP-5441.

Despite the comedic inclinations of this narrative causing Site-67 personnel to display incompetent and/or highly unprofessional behaviour, the productive output of those affected remains exceptional.

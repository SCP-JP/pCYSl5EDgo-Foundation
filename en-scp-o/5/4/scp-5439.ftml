//[Mr. Falkner is by the whiteboard presenting the results of a recent survey on site security. Mrs. Ramirez, Dr. Marly and Dr. Crowler are present at the table. Dr. Crowler scratches her nose.]//

**Mr. Falkner:** As you can see, fire exits are blocked almost at all exits but-

**Dr. Crowler:** Oh god damn it.

**Mr. Falkner:** ...We are probably going to have to intervene in another conference on the five steps of site security if things are going to chang-

**Mrs. Ramirez:** Are- are you alright Dr. Crowler?

//[Dr. Crowler is rubbing her palm against her nose tip.]//

**Dr. Crowler:** Yeah yeah, it just itches so bad on the inside.

**Mrs. Ramirez:** But Dr. Crowle- Oh Jesus!

//[A snap is heard, which is believed to be the sound of Dr. Crowler's nasal bone. Dr. Crowler continues pressing and rubbing her nose, ignoring her co-workers protests. Her nasal bone structure cracks and is crushed completely. She sighs and wipes off some of the blood that has wetted her mouth and chin.]//

**Dr. Crowler:** Aahh... That's better.

**Item #:** SCP-5489

**Object Class:** --Keter-- Integrated

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5489 does not leave the boundaries of Site-48. Personnel are cautioned to use discretion when discussing classified information while SCP-5489 is unaccounted for. When SCP-5489 is located, personnel are to pretend to be oblivious to the anomaly and use designated hand signal to notify site security. Security will determine on a case-by-case basis whether to move SCP-5489 from point of manifestation.

**Edit 10/12/1996:** SCP-5489 has currently taken residence in the Site-48 pool supply closet. Personnel are forbidden from discussing classified topics in pool area. Researcher Ustinov is instructed to continue counter-espionage campaign at least once per work day. Custodial staff have been instructed to refuse to acknowledge presence of SCP-5489 behind the locker.

**Description:** SCP-5489 is a covert listening device created by GoI-16 which has infiltrated Site-48. SCP-5489 is a passive cavity resonator[[footnote]]Device is surrounded by a membrane microphone composed of unknown material.[[/footnote]] with no power supply; when 'illuminated' by correct radio frequency identification[[footnote]]610 to 640MHz[[/footnote]], audio data can be transmitted through SCP-5489 to a radio demodulator. Although this demodulator has never been recovered, and although ultra-high frequencies operate via line-of-sight propagation, it is believed that SCP-5489 is transmitting this data to points outside of Site-48. SCP-5489 is sapient, capable of spontaneous translocation, and cannot be contained at a fixed location. Item has the superficial appearance of a framed photograph of former US President Richard Nixon, which changes with every relocation event.
 
**Addendum- Incidents:** Item was discovered on 05/25/1989 by Officer Gomez. Object identified by CCTV to have manifested within right main elevator platform at 13:02. Unknown if object had infiltrated site prior to this.

Wouldn't be covert if the picture on your coffee table was the wrong president. When Theremin did that, though, he couldn't get it to work on Ford, or Carter, or even that pig Reagan. Just Nixon.

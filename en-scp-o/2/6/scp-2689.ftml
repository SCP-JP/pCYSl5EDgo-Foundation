[[include component:image-block name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-2689/Percy|caption=SCP-2689 in containment|width=250px]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2689 is to be kept in a standard fish tank located at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169 Site-169's] break room. Attempts to accumulate other possible instances have been abandoned per order of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED) due to their non-disruptive nature.

----

**Description:** SCP-2689 designates a male blood parrot cichlid,[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]//Amphilophus citrinellus × Vieja melanurus//[[/span]] more colloquially referred to as "Percy" by Foundation personnel. Physically, it is similar to other non-anomalous members of its species.

SCP-2689's main abnormality is its ability to induce a slightly heightened level of motivation and serenity in those who observe the specimen.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]This anomaly is also present in recordings and photographs.[[/span]] This effect lasts for approximately ten minutes following cessation of visual contact. It is presently unknown how SCP-2689 possessed these unusual properties, though investigation into its origins has been denied for the time being.

----

**Discovery:** SCP-2689 was initially obtained at an annual festival that was held within [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sun-talk Prescott Valley,] when Dr. Mayfield won the anomaly at one of the town's stalls. Although, its anomalous properties would not be discovered until her decision to transfer SCP-2689 to Site-169 a week afterward.

As a result of its relocation, personnel and anomaly morale had increased considerably. Research into the cause revealed SCP-2689's abnormal qualities, subsequently leading to its official designation as an SCP object.

**Foreword:** The following is a recording log of Drs. Kirby Case and Melissa Mayfield's conversation regarding SCP-2689's retrieval. Footage was taken within the facility's break room.

= **[BEGIN LOG]**

//(The two are staring at SCP-2689, which is swimming around in its tank. Case is sipping from their coffee mug while Mayfield is wiping her spectacles.)//

**Case:** So you got this guy at the festival?

**Mayfield:** Hm? Oh, yeah. I got it from a stall. It's a game where you catch fish with a paper net. First try, too.

**Case:** Really now? Good for you.

//(Case pauses then chuckles. Mayfield raises an eyebrow.)//

**Mayfield:** What's so funny?

**Case:** Ah, nothing. It's that… (//chuckles//) I'm just picturing a grown woman like you participating in such a game. Somehow, it fits.

**Mayfield:** Oh, be quiet! Can't a woman enjoy her free time? I managed to scoop up Percy here too.

**Case:** I know, I know. I don't mean to offend.

//(Mayfield puts on her glasses.)//

**Case:** I'm surprised you had the time to even go to the festival. Don't you usually have a tight schedule?

**Mayfield:** I'm not the only counselor here, Kirby. My kindness just overtakes my will for free time.

**Case:** (//Scoffs//) Well, aren't you so noble?

//(The both of them laugh.)//

**Mayfield:** You think there are others like Percy? Shouldn't we do something about that?

**Case:** Ah, no worries. Even if there are similar ones, I doubt they would be a worry any time soon. They're just fishes, after all.

//(Case looks over the various items surrounding SCP-2689's tank: Drawings of the specimen, aquatic-themed decorations, and photographs.)//

**Case:** Besides, it'd break my heart to steal them from other people. We're not the only caretakers out there, you know?

**Mayfield:** Heh, you can say that again.

//(Case takes another sip.)//

**Case:** (//Sighs//) Man, I should really stop and enjoy times like these. Sitting here, having a nice cup of joe—

**Mayfield:** Eyeing on the… hm… the happy fish? Yeah, the happy fish.

**Case:** Very happy fish, indeed.

//(The two laugh, focusing on SCP-2689.)//

**Mayfield:** But yeah, I agree… sometimes it's all about the little things.

//(SCP-2689 briefly faces the both of them before swimming off.)//

**Mayfield:** (//Quietly//) …All the little things in life.

Hello, everyone!

This is just a reminder that we'll be having an upcoming welcoming party for our dear fish Percy. Make sure you wear clothes fit for the party's theme: 'Under the Sea'.

It will also serve as a commemoration for him, for bringing us just a little spark of positivity every once in a while. And obviously because I want my fish (that's right, //my// fish) to have a grand time here at the facility.

With that said, we'll see you there. Have a fishtastic day, everyone!

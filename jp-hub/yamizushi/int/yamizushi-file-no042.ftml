[[size 120%]]**Overview**[[/size]]

The name, California roll is not a specific sushi's, but a name of a category on shape or a cooking method. It is necessary that it is "a rolled sushi without encircling laver". Westerners seem not to like laver, so foreign sushi are often shortage, decreasing of laver or/and having internal laver.

Its ingredients are various: typically avocado, omelet or cooked seafood (most are crab, shrimp or crab stick) and sometimes mayonnaise sauce, cucumber, cream cheese or smoked salmon. Also, because of lack of external laver, its syari[[footnote]] **Transrator's note:** It is a sushi's foundation made of rice. Sushi's ingredients are often on syari. [[/footnote]] is exposed or spread sesames or flying fish roes.

It has no fatal flaw and is a tractable sushi. Even a westerner who is not accustomed to the sushi culture can use it easily. I hear that its usage rate in international conventions is high, but it tends to be treated as heresy sushi in Japan yet.

In the sentence above, I wrote it has no flaw. Conversely, it has no trademark too. Especially, its Attack and Defense are sometimes less than other roll sushi's, because of lack of external laver. When you use it, you should try to let it run away and endure. Fortunately, its speed and stamina are not bad.

In the case that attack directly a blader with it, It is not an effective sushi. In other words, we can use it to do "Mine-Uchi"--　--[[[wagnascousin-2 |giving damage which makes an opponent faint for a short time, without fatal injury]]]. It is difficult to control Ramen's power.

I would also like to mention the scalability through customization of ingredients. Sushi's ingredients are mainly concerned with Weight and Speed. The difference between one customized and the other is so slight that it doesn't matter much, but the difference in blader skills. However, in a match between two players of the same level, the difference may make victory or defeat. As an instance of such a game, I refer to Sushiblade World Championship 2017 Elimination round of north america B block Final game.

[[size 120%]]**Other usage**[[/size]]

To use to do a mental intervention with sushi (a.k.a sumeshi brainwashing). [[[\sushi-go-round-or-spining-sushi |Tuna sushi is often used to do sumeshi brainwashing]]], but using California roll is considered when do sumeshi brainwashing to (often a westerner) those who has a mental rejection against raw fish (and laver)[[footnote]] It is some kind of double meaning. It is known that "the rejection of specific food from a food cultural background" corresponds "the rejection against a mental intervention with the food". [[/footnote]].

[[size 120%]]**Episode**[[/size]]

I write about a strange California roll user whom I encountered in the following.

On November 27th 2019, I was in Osaka, actually in order to research about the food culture of flour. When I finished research in that day and was coming back to the lodging place, I felt a strange aura from a maze of the alley. It might be at over 22 O'clock. A new moon and the city could not cast its light in the dark, but my curiosity leet me enter to there.

There, two figures were facing each other, and seemed to be arguing about something. One of them is [[[af2020jp-youtube |a woman having beasts ear]]][[footnote]] By the way, even today, the normal sushi community seems to have an aversion to women making sushi. It's an old-fashioned value, and a sad one at that. As long as somebody is good at making a sushi and sushiblade, she should be appreciated without her gender. [[/footnote]] and the other is a long hair person whom I can't recognize as what its sex is. I could find that both are unhuman.

The following is the output of the conversation by writing. It depends on my memory so please note that it may not be precisely.

> **Beasts ear** "Why do you, one of Mihashira-no-uzu-no-miko lose your mind on [[[collected-item-no3434 |Sushisumo]]][[footnote]] According to a data, it is a name of the game in which sushiblade originates. It is suspect to originate in Edo era. [[/footnote]]? Your sister worries about you!" 
> 
> **Long hair** "Hum! What meaning does Uzu-no-miko have? Everyone hail only my sister and brother! One is the greatest Japanese god who administrates Takama-ga-hara! The other is the hero who defeated Yahata-no-orochi! Do I have something such? No!"
> 
> **Long hair** "If you want me to come back, defeat me by Sushisumo...No, Sushiblade!"

Then, One with Long hair took a California roll. its surface rice is very brilliant and I almost shouted in admiration. In the other hand, one with beasts ear took Inari-sushi[[footnote]] **Translator's note:** Inari-sushi is sushi wrapped in fried tofu. Inari means gods of fox and fried tofu is fox's favorite food in Japanese fiction. [[/footnote]]. It was also an attractive sushi with a fluffy fried tofu. I wanted to approach and to observe it, but I shouldn't spoil the game so I hid not to be found.

> **Beasts ear** "Despite a Japanese god, you choose the foreign sushi..."
> 
> **Long hair** "Say what you like!" 
> 
> **Long hair** "3, 2, 1, Hey Rassyai!"
> 
> **Beasts ear** "Hī, Fū, Mī,[[footnote]] **Translator's note:** It means "One, Two, Three" with the Japanese traditional way of counting. [[/footnote]] Hey Rassyai!"

Both launched each sushi. Then, I calculated that the California roll's user will choose a tactics running away. California roll is faster and more persistent than Inari-sushi, while its attack is defended by Inari-sushi's fried tofu, I thought. However, this calculation was wrong. The California roll crushed straight into the Inari-sushi and scooped its fried tofu.

> **Beasts ear** "What's? Syari cannot have such power!"
> 
> **Long hair** "If it has just ordinary syari, it is correct what you said...isn't it?"
> 
> **Beasts ear** "Perhaps, this syari is…！"
> 
> **Long hair** "Yes...It is the very rice I got when I killed Ukemochi!"

The California roll bounced off the Inari-sushi with its own momentum. And the game was over. Beasts ear gathered some pieces of the Inari-sushi and ate it, and then disappeared. Long hair saw it out and then disappeared too. I would have loved to have fought against them. At that moment, I succeeded in recovering some pieces of the Inari-sushi in secret.

"Ukemochi", the name said by Long hair supposed to be referred as [[span class="ruby"]]保食神[[span class="rt"]]Ukemochi-no-kami[[/span]][[/span]], a fertility god in Chronicles of Japan. A storyline of the myth is the following. In brief, "Ukemochi-no-kami had an ability to generate foods from her mouth, but Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto was so angry to be served them by her that Tsukuyomi killed her. Then, the every crops was generated from her corpse, which is origin of Japanese agriculture."

I guess that the person made the syari of the rice grains with a spiritual energy, and cooked the sushi with shape which take best advantage of the syari power --　-- viz. the California roll, whose laver doesn't interfere with the syari power.

A graph of the performance of the California Roll would look like this (note that it is based on the subjective opinion of the file author). It is worth noting that Attack and Defence are greatly improved. However, because of the need to use special ingredients for customization and the possibility that the user will also require special skills, I estimated Usability to be low.

I don't find whether The California roll user was an actual god, a wizard or something that just calls itself the name. However, the incident made me re-recognize the basis strategy that "a sushiblade can be enhanced by careful selecting its ingredients" and led me to see the value in exploring mystical and magical ingredients.

I put a home shrine in my kitchen now. [[span class="ruby"]]月読尊[[span class="rt"]]Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto[[/span]][[/span]] is enshrined in it. It means praying to re-encountering the California roll user, the long hair blader again and to fight and aiming for whom to defeat. I'll get power to defeat even gods someday. Possibility of sushi is boundless.

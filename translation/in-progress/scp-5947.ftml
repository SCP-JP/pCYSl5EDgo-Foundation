**Item â„–:** SCP-5947

**Anomaly Class:** --Euclid-- Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5947 is currently held in the silver sugar bowl it was recovered from. This bowl is housed in Chamber 02 at Site-90 alongside 88 decoy bowls, identical save for the lack of a hallmark on the base. Once monthly, a member of D-Class personnel is to enter Chamber 02 and select one of the bowls at random -- they will then be instructed to consume its contents, and staff are permitted to use physical force to ensure they comply. In the event that they selected a bowl not containing SCP-5947, they are to be terminated immediately and their body interred beneath Chamber 02. In the event that they select and consume SCP-5947, they are to be escorted from the chamber and assigned to Project Irides[[footnote]]For more information, see addendum, or consult supplementary materials regarding second sight.[[/footnote]] once SCP-5947 has passed through their digestive system.

The discovery of a cadaver visually matching William Hazen Rogers outside of Site-90 constitutes a containment breach. MTF Alpha-Kaunan ("Argent Devotees") should be dispatched to recover the body, as well as any silverware within an 80 metre radius. This silver is to be melted down and re-cast into decoy bowls, to be filled with non-anomalous sugar and added to Chamber 02. The cadaver is to be interred beneath the chamber alongside the others.

[[%%content{0}%%include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5947/fishfood.jpg | caption=SCP-5947]]

**Description:** SCP-5947 is the designation for a collection of dried anchovies, one of which (SCP-5947-1) is indestructible. Twice per day, at midnight and noon, ##blue|SCP-5947-1## will split into two identical dried anchovies.

**Addendum:** On the order of Director Smith, all personnel assigned to CANUAR-Site-90 have been integrated into Project Irides. Anomalous objects extraneous to Project Irides have been decommissioned.

Dear Director Smith,

As of today, the Council has voted 1-12-0 on the issue of dismantling Project Irides. Furthermore, the Council has voted, 12-1-0, to overrule objections from the former Site-90 Ethics Committee, ensuring that your project continues regardless of their past rulings on the matter.

It is the majority opinion of the O5 Council that the existence of Project Irides has given the Foundation an advantage in dealing with several major Groups of Interest, not the least of which being GoIs-004C and -023. [[[site-17-hub|By dominating the concept of silver]]], the Foundation has forced them to abandon significant holdings and resources, putting us in a better position to negotiate with, or combat, such threats.

On an official basis, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience these proceedings have caused you.

Mr. Smith,

First: Welcome to CANUAR-Site-90. It's not as glamorous as field work, but you're less likely to lose another foot. And hey, we have on-site therapists if you need someone to talk to.

Second: You have been assigned to the SCP-5947 project. It's not much, but I suppose that's the point. Hopefully I can give you an environment to recuperate while you work on your doctorate.

Third: I'm sorry. Wish we could've glassed those Mekhanites, but no use crying over spilt milk.

Godspeed,

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5947 is to be stored in a refrigerated locker in Chamber 02 of Site-90. Each week, containment personnel are to identify and isolate SCP-5947-1 from the rest of SCP-5947; remaining instances of SCP-5947 are to be ground into a slurry and used or disposed of as appropriate.

= **HISTORY**
[[/size]]

SCP-5947 was acquired in an anomalous item exchange conducted with GoI-023 ("MC&D Ltd.") under the Burnett Accord. In addition to items and resources negotiated under the Burnett Accord, PoI-MCD003 ("Percival Darke") had included SCP-5947 within a silver sugar plate as part of his three "contractually-allotted indignities".

As per protocol regarding unexpected gifts from non-partnered Groups of Interest, SCP-5947 was transferred to CANUAR-Site-90, an isolated containment site dedicated to countering mundane and anomalous espionage. Following a round of preliminary testing, SCP-5947's anomalous properties were successfully identified, and containment procedures were finalized on 26/05/1967.

= **IN ACCORDANCE TO THE BURNETT ACCORD**

The following is a receipt of the three contractually-obligated indignities bestowed upon the SCP Foundation. The contents of this receipt, with regards to the text, are not legally binding and cannot be used in further negotiations or legalistic thaumaturgical rituals.

The items are as follows, as well as justifications for such indignities:
* One (1) obligation to document this receipt in your official database. Such an indignity is intended as backlash against the heavy doctoring of associated documentation for anomalous objects transferred to Marshall Carter & Darke's possession.
* One (1) heirloom sugar bowl, to be used only to contain the third indignity. Such an indignity is intended to demonstrate the ease with which Marshall Carter & Darke can deploy its wealth against the SCP Foundation.
* One (1) invulnerable anchovy, to replicate into a series of mundane anchovies at the peak and trough of the sun. Such an obligation is intended as a personal insult to you, specifically, Dr. Rochefort, a mockery engineered solely to make your work the tiniest bit harder. I know you don't like anchovies; not many people do. Find a use for it sooner rather than later.

+ ON THE WEAPONIZATION OF PSYCHOCONCEPTUAL HUMILIATION

++ by Dr. Silas Smith
[[/=]]
**Abstract:**

This study examined the usage of reverse-engineered beryllium-bronze containment devices (such as those employed by GoI-3088 ("Church of the Second Hytoth") and SoI-004 ("The Imit")) to weaponize both abstract concepts and ideas grounded to physical objects. Over a two year period (December 8th, 1997-December 6th, 1999), such devices were attuned to the concept of a series of 12 cm by 2.8 cm oak blocks painted with the logo of subordinate Group of Interest GoI-952's ("Olney Ironworks") logo.

Using three groups of 1000 blocks (painted blocks, blocks that would not be painted, and blocks which would be painted after a period of a year), the Foundation would employ each on a monthly rotation as foci for experimental psychoconceptual channeling units. Additionally, every fourth month would see the activation of the channeling units without the use of foci. Agents embedded into GoI-952 would examine trends in gross income and workplace safety...

Dr. Smith,

Congratulations on receiving your doctorate. I'm... skeptical regarding the applications of such a thesis, especially how it pertains to Site-90.

Are you feeling alright? It's normal for graduate studies to take a toll on your well-being, but last I saw you, you were unusually... stiff, is the only word that comes to mind. Take a breather: you're done. Worry about some self-replicating pizza toppings for the time being.

Dr. Smith,

Your request has been received, and summarily denied.

The schematics you have provided are nearly incomprehensible. Furthermore, the ramifications of such a device's very existence would outweigh whatever good its functions may bring to the Foundation.

Honestly? I'm worried about you. Most of your free time is spent tilting this particular windmill. I get it, Silas, but it feels like you're attempting to hammer a round peg into a square hole. Site-90 isn't Foundation Overwatch; they deal with the spies, we deal with the cameras.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

++ With regards to Chamber 02's renovations

So, Dr. Smith, let me get this straight:
* You want thirty sugar bowls scattered across the floor. Not welded, adhered, just scattered.
* Furthermore, you want me to include a Smith Channeler Unit scaled large enough to embed itself into Chamber 02's walls, while retaining the size of the focus (which will remain buried in the concrete).
* You want me to //hollow out// the area above //and// beneath Chamber 02.

We can do that, sure. It's gonna screw the budget, but we can definitely do all of that once our BB shipments resolve. I just need to make sure I read your letter correctly; I mean no offense, but handwriting can get lost in translation, and I need to know if you meant all of this.

Side note: you alright? You looked very pale and jittery last I saw you, and I haven't gotten an email from you since your doctorate. Did something change with SCP-5947?

Well, Irides ran out of space, money, and Director Regan's patience.

After some prep work, it's been found that your realization of Irides is gonna intrude on URA-3721. Moreover, the other researchers aren't too fond of what we already have; it's doing something to the morale, more than just the fact that it makes construction noises even on off-hours. 

And again: are you alright? This is all you're talking about. Sometimes it feels like you're an intermediary between me and Irides. I can't even ping your Scipnet account; what's happening?

On 30/08/2002, URA-3721 disappeared from containment, and Dr. Aningan Regan and Jared Morello failed to clock in at their usual times. Security audits indicated that neither had left the premises of CANUAR-Site-90, A search was initiated; however, no evidence of wrongdoing was uncovered.

On 02/09/2002, maintenance personnel reported a pungent odor from Chamber 02. Preliminary investigation revealed the presence of apparent human viscera in the space below Chamber 02, as well as the shattered remains of URA-3721. Recovery attempts were hindered, however, by architectural quirks in the recently renovated Chamber 02, which provided no means of egress from the space below.

Plans to deconstruct Chamber 02 were considered, but ultimately scrapped at the direction of CANUAR-Site-90 Director Silas Smith.

Renovation of Chamber 02 is presently set to continue.

Hello, and sorry for the third email in a month.

Is there any progress on the Chamber 02 case? It doesn't feel like too much it's been fixed; actually, it feels like it's gotten worse. The smell's starting to spread outside the chamber proper, and the construction noises aren't any quieter. Whatever they're doing when they're not expanding, it's still happening.

I also think it's taking some kind of toll on my coworkers. It's been weeks since I last saw some of them. Actually, I didn't really notice until I started writing this letter, but I haven't seen too many of our projects, either.

Another thing: apparently I've been assigned to Chamber 02? Nobody told me anything, but my file permissions were shifted around and the file that used to be SCP-239 has been archived. I've tried asking around, and I haven't gotten a response.

Again, apologies for the repeat message, but I'm beginning to feel powerless. Like I'm being watched by a giant.

I'm sorry to bother you, Director Silas, but I have a few questions if you don't mind:
* Is something wrong with the Scipnet server? I know Site-90 is supposed to be an isolated site, but your email is the only one I can ping.
* What's that smell? I assume it's fish, but I didn't expect to smell it until I got to the chamber.

//PoI-000 enters through the main ground-floor entrance. They briefly vocalize shock, before activating a flashlight and taking their first steps into the interior.//

//PoI-000 attempts to proceed further into the site, but appears to be distracted by a portion of the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit. Pulling out an electronic device, PoI-000 places a clamp onto one of the pipes, pausing presumably to take a reading before quickly unclamping from the unit and continuing onward.//

//PoI-000 appears to accidentally hit their head on the unit as they make their way out of the Atrium.//

//PoI-000 continues through the 1st-floor South Hallways; they appear to experience difficulty navigating around the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit.//

//Ignoring the stairwell and administrative offices, PoI-000 continues down the hallway until they reach the wall-mounted map of the Site-90 complex. They spend several minutes examining the map, occasionally looking away to monitor the hallway. Eventually, PoI-000 continues along their way.//

//PoI-000 enters the 1st-Floor Break Room with apparent difficulty, spending several minutes attempting to navigate through a portion of the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit.//

//Once inside the 1st-Floor Break Room, PoI-000 pulls out their electronic device, taking a picture of the 1st-Floor Break Room, which SILVERFISH.aic automatically logs.//

//PoI-000 suddenly startles, turning towards the general direction of Chamber 02. They attempt to climb the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit; however, the grated ceiling hinders their progress, forcing them to remove a section of ceiling with a multi-tool. Climbing through the hole in the ceiling, PoI-000 enters the 2nd-Floor South Hallways.//

//Emerging into the 2nd-Floor South Hallways, PoI-000 moves to stand before immediately kneeling to retch.//

//Several minutes pass before PoI-000 collects their bearings, navigating the dense piping of the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit towards Chamber 02.//

//Upon entering Chamber 02, PoI-000 is immediately drawn to SCP-5947. They do not attempt to survey the rest of Chamber 02 at this time.//

//PoI-000 stops approximately .5 meters from SCP-5947, bending down to examine it with their mouth and nose covered. Several minutes pass; during this time, PoI-000 dissects two instances of SCP-5947 and attempts to analyze more through their electronic device. Eventually, PoI-000 stands up and turns to leave, at which point Director Smith impales them through their midsection.//

//Director Smith drags PoI-000 back to SCP-5947, forcing their face onto the containment bowl. PoI-000 is held there for several minutes, until they begin eating SCP-5947 at Director Smith's direction. Eventually, PoI-000 is able to finish SCP-5947 without gagging.//

//As PoI-000 has successfully completed SCP-5947's containment ritual, Director Smith drags them towards the iron stairs leading towards the space above Chamber 02. PoI-000 briefly struggles against Director Smith, before going limp from apparent shock.//

//Director Smith pulls PoI-000 beyond the threshold and deposits them beneath the SILVERFISH primary containment unit. In turn, SILVERFISH comes out of Hibernation Mode. After reviewing the Automated Surveillance Log, SILVERFISH measures PoI-000's neck, before proceeding with integration.//

//Two days later, SILVERFISH's focal cadaver stirs, indicating a successful integration.//

##blue|**Description:** SCP-4175 is a Level-I Humanoid Apparition which can be viewed in the reflection of a bathroom vanity mirror. SCP-4175 is theorized to be the spectral remains of Alex Conrad, the thirteen-year-old victim of premeditated homicide committed by his parents on August 30, 2014.##
**説明:** SCP-4715はレベルⅠ霊的人型実体でありバスルームの化粧鏡の鏡像の中に見ることが可能です。SCP-4175は2014/8/30に彼の両親に計画的に殺された13歳のアレックス・コンラッドの霊的遺留物であると理論上想定されています。
##blue|SCP-4175 has demonstrated the ability to interact with various objects within the room in attempts to communicate with any individuals present, including the following:##
SCP-4175は部屋の中の以下の様々な物体に作用する能力を発揮してその場にいるならどのような人物であろうともコミュニケーションを取ろうとします。
* ##blue|Manipulating the curtains of the bathroom shower.##
* バスルームシャワーのカーテン操作
* ##blue|Activating and extinguishing the mirror's vanity lights.##
* 化粧鏡の照明のオンオフ
* ##blue|Manifesting bloodstains on the floor tile which spell simple words.##
* 床のタイル上の血糊出現による単純な文
##blue|More direct communication has been achieved by introducing water vapor to the room by way of the showerhead and inscribing words on the mirror, at which point SCP-4175 may respond in a similar manner.##
より直接的なコミュニケーションはシャワーヘッドから出た湯気を部屋に入れ、鏡面に言葉をなぞることにより達成されます。この時、SCP-4175も同様にして返答するでしょう。
##blue|**Addendum.4175.1:** Initial Interview of Apparition##
**補遺4175.1:** 霊への初期インタビュー
##blue|Following the acquisition of SCP-4175, MTF Psi-8 was contacted to perform a low-priority intake interview with SCP-4175. ψ-8 Maria Hayes was dispatched by ψ-8 Commander Seojun Cortez to Site-17.##
SCP-4175の確保に引き続き、機動部隊プサイ-8はSCP-4175に対して低優先度導入面接を行いました。ψ-8 マリア・ヘイズはψ-8司令ソジュン・コルテッツによりサイト-17に派遣されました。

##blue|**Preliminary Note:** A year prior to the attached intake interview, ψ-8 Maria Hayes requested access to [[[SCP-113]]] for the purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria. The request was denied due to the cost of transporting the item.##
**付記:** 添付された導入面接の1年前にψ-8 マリア・ヘイズは性別違和の緩和を目的として[[[SCP-113]]]へのアクセスを要求しました。アイテムの移送費用のため要求は却下されました。

##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Hello. Are you feeling alright?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Jesus, that hurts. What'd you do to me?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** I pulled you out of the mirror for a bit. I need to ask you a few questions, and then I'll be on my way. I figured it'd be easier to have this talk face-to-face.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Questions? Can I ask any?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** After our interview, sure. Alright, starting off: Is your name Alex Conrad?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Yeah.##

##blue|**SCP-4175:** "Previous life"? I'm dead?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Unfortunately, yes, you are. It's fine, though! For whatever reason, your consciousness decided to stick around in the mirror. So —##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** I – I mean, when I woke up in the mirror I //thought// I might be dead, but if I'm actually gone... does my family know I'm still here?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** No, we haven't alerted them. Listen, it's going to be fine. I've dealt with spectral phenomena for years, I know a thing or two about death.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Alright. Okay. Just... find a way to get me out of there. I can't stay in that mirror much longer. It's awful.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Can you describe what it's like? If you need a break, we can resume the interview in a little while.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** No, please, I'm fine.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|//SCP-4175 is silent for several seconds.//##
////
##blue|**SCP-4175:** It's dark in there. Tight, too, like you're being crushed on all sides. I'd almost say there's nothing, except for me. It feels wrong, like I'm just not supposed to be there.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Can you see through the mirror on your side?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Kind of. I can actually see the mirror, just... well, it's a mirror.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Is there something wrong?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** It's all wrong. My face has holes in it, and it's rotting.##

##blue|//SCP-4175 begins to demonstrate signs of acute distress, its voice edging on hysteria.//##

##blue|**SCP-4175:** Is that me? Is my real body just decomposing somewhere? Did they ever find my body?##

##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Hey, hold on! You're fine!##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|//ψ-8 Hayes motions towards the floor and both move to sit next to the vanity cabinets.//##

##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Everything's going to be okay. After they've researched you a little more, they'll probably call me in to exorcise you. Err, to help you to the afterlife.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** You're not one of the scientists?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** No, I travel around the world and talk to ghosts and spirits. Coolest job on the planet.##

**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|//ψ-8 Hayes audibly sighs.//##
////
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Most of them, yeah, which is why I help them get to the next life when I can. In the field, I get to choose if I want to neutralize them or not, but I don't think I have that power for contained anomalies.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** That sucks.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Yeah, it does.##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|//Both are silent for several seconds.//##
////
##blue|**SCP-4175:** I think I'm jealous of you.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Me or my job?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Both, I guess. You're alive and you have an awesome job, helping people. I think the worst part about being stuck in that mirror is that I know everyone outside is living their lives like everything is normal. I want to be like them so much.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** But you're trapped with yourself, which you hate the sight of?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Yeah, actually.##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Well, I know a few tricks to stave off the existential dread. Want to hear them?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** Sure! Um, are we being recorded right now?##
**SCP-4175:** 
##blue|**ψ-8 Hayes:** Yeah, is that a problem?##
**ψ-8 ヘイズ:** 
##blue|**SCP-4175:** No, I mean... yeah, it feels a little intrusive.##
**SCP-4175:**

**Afterword:** ψ-8 Hayes conversed with SCP-4175 for forty-eight more minutes before emerging from the containment unit. Given that all questions on the intake interview had been satisfactorily answered, the breach of protocol was considered to be of negligible severity. ψ-8 Hayes was reprimanded by ψ-8 Commander Cortez with two weeks suspension for insubordination.
ψ-8 Hayes has also requested specialized Clearance Level 2/4175 for continued testing on SCP-4175. The request has been approved by junior researcher [[[APAS | Natalie Reems]]].

##blue|It has come to our attention that an anomalous entity has been contained at Site-17 and designated SCP-4175. As you are aware, this item is a sapient, humanoid apparition; Standard Ethical Treatment of Humanoid Anomalies therefore apply. SCP-4175 has offered little of value to the Department of Spectral Phenomena in terms of research and has expressed discontentment with its condition as an apparition. Because Site-17 possesses the means to [[[SCP-4456 | decommission]]] SCP-4175 via the Spectral Dispersal rituals available to MTF Psi-8, allowing SCP-4175 to remain in containment has been deemed unethical by the Ethics Subcommittee for Humanoid Entities. Taking into account [[[SCP-4051 | past malfeasance relating to humanoid anomalies]]], failure to decommission SCP-4175 will be seen as symptomatic of a misunderstanding of basic ethical practices persistent in Site-17 personnel, yourself included.##

##blue|As of September 8, 2015, SCP-4175 has been declared Decommissioned. The anomaly was personally dispersed by ψ-8 Hayes, who has neglected to archive the audio log of the procedure. The recovery of this audio log is considered non-essential. The video log of the procedure was retrieved, however.##

##blue|//ψ-8 Hayes enters the containment chamber, carrying several occult items appropriate for the dispersion rituals detailed in the Rites of Kam. She greets SCP-4175, setting down the items on the counter in front of it.//##
##blue|//SCP-4175 and ψ-8 Hayes converse for several minutes as the ritual is prepared. The contents of this discussion are as of yet unknown, but neither appear distressed.//##
##blue|//ψ-8 Hayes begins the dispersion ritual while maintaining conversation with SCP-4175, who is seen to gradually fade from the mirror over the course of fifteen minutes.//##
##blue|//SCP-4175 and ψ-8 Hayes cease their conversation as SCP-4175 becomes barely visible. SCP-4175 speaks a final time, to which ψ-8 Hayes replies, and SCP-4175 completely demanifests.//##

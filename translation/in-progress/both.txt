##blue|**Description:** SCP-4051 is a male humanoid which can create temporary Class-E wormholes to extradimensional spaces populated by a theoretically infinite number of a unique item. These items are able to be removed from the extradimensional space, given that they are physically able to fit through the wormhole. Testing has concluded that SCP-4051 is unable to alter the contents of the extradimensional space after manifestation.##
##blue|SCP-4051 has been able to manifest the following items during controlled experiments overseen by Dr. Edwards at Site-17. Manifested items detailed in the relevant experiment logs below have been omitted.##
* ##blue|A small, weighted net, measuring 3 m^^2^^.##
* ##blue|A standard pharmaceutical container of sugar pills, although the label describes the pills as headache medication.##
* ##blue|A glass of drinking water.##
##blue|SCP-4051 has either claimed or has been reported to have manifested the following items outside of experiments sanctioned by Dr. Edwards.##
* ##blue|An aluminum baseball bat.##
* ##blue|Several rolls of duct tape.##
* ##blue|An incendiary device and blast-proof sheet.##
* ##blue|Eleven instances of Class-E paracognitohazards.##
##blue|--SCP-4051 has been allowed to use its anomalous abilities to assist with general repairs at Site-17.-- After retroactive review of all procedures and programs relating to SCP-4051's containment by the Ethics Committee and subsequent evaluation by the Foundation Containment Committee, SCP-4051's presence outside of its containment unit has been demonstrated to be a substantial threat to any and all personnel located at Site-17.##
##blue|**Recovery:** SCP-4051 was first brought to the attention of Foundation operatives in August of 2012 when a video depicting it using its anomalous abilities began to gain significant online attention. The recording depicted SCP-4051 assaulting and detaining several men via its anomalous abilities.##
##blue|The video gained over two million views before warranting an intervention, following multiple testimonies by commenters of similar occurrences. [[[task-forces#pi-1 | Mobile Task Force Pi-1 "City Slickers"]]] identified SCP-4051 and performed a successful retrieval and extraction.##

**Interviewed:** SCP-4051

**Interviewer:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.

------

**Foreword:** Due to SCP-4051’s resistance during its retrieval, SCP-4051 has been separated from Dr. Roswell by a one-way glass barrier and is handcuffed to a chair.

**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Roswell:** Greetings. My name is Dr. Roswell. Is your name Rainer Miller?

//SCP-4051 is heard struggling against its handcuffs.//

**Dr. Roswell:** Rainer, it would be helpful if you could remain still for the rest of this interview.

**SCP-4051:** Where am I?

**Dr. Roswell:** A safe place, I assure you.

//SCP-4051 is silent.//

**Dr. Roswell:** Please, explain your anomalous capabilities to us.

**SCP-4051:** My… are you government guys? Sorry. Um, I can make things appear out of thin air.

**Dr. Roswell:** Anything you want?

**SCP-4051:** Kind of. Only small objects, I think. I mostly use it to help people.

**Dr. Roswell:** You’re referring to your vigilantism?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah. It used to be carjackings and thefts and stuff, but recently I’ve gotten involved with this group called the Looming Shadow. They’re stealing money for something, so I have to do nightly patrols. I tried contacting the police, but I’m pretty sure they’ve been bought out. Actually, wait, could you guys do anything about it?

**Dr. Roswell:** I’ll send a request. Do you know if anyone has seen you use your anomalous capabilities?

**SCP-4051:** A few people, yeah. I helped this one woman a while back, and there have probably been a few I don’t know about. I try to keep this stuff quiet.

**Dr. Roswell:** Alright. I think that will conclude this interview. You will--

**SCP-4051:** Wait, hold on, do you have anything else to ask me?

**Dr. Roswell:** Not at the moment. Why do you ask?

**SCP-4051:** If you guys want to know anything else about this thing that I have, I'd be happy to help.

**Dr. Roswell:** Your willingness to work with us is appreciated. Thank you.

**SCP-4051:** You’re welcome.

__**Experiment 4051-e-1:**__
**Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
**Date:** 08/15/2012
**Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest several items by Dr. Roswell: a 3 cm^^3^^ cube of lead, an object of SCP-4051's choice, and a container of bleach.
**Results:** SCP-4051 produced the cube after some hesitation. Requests for an object of its choice resulted in SCP-4051 removing a framed picture of its mother. SCP-4051 expressed discomfort at being requested to remove the bleach but complied without incident.
**Afterword:** SCP-4051 was escorted back to its containment unit and reportedly asked how long it would need to test its anomalous properties. Site staff were informed that they ought to avoid the question if possible, for the continuation of SCP-4051’s compliance.
------
> **Note:** Seems like it needs to have a clear mental image before it can manifest anything. More testing to determine boundaries of its anomaly will follow.

__**Experiment 4051-e-2:**__
**Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
**Date:** 08/16/2012
**Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a copy of Leo Tolstoy’s //War and Peace// and a functioning mobile phone.
**Results:** The produced copy of Tolstoy's novel displayed the English words "War and Peace" written in large font on a blank cover. Most pages of the book contained redundant gibberish tangentially related to war, and SCP-4051 confessed that it was unfamiliar with the contents of the novel.
The mobile phone that was manifested appeared to be unremarkable until attempts were made to operate it, and it was revealed to be completely hollow.
**Afterword:** As SCP-4051 was being escorted back to its containment unit, it asked repeatedly how its family was, and if it could have any company as it waited for the next test. All questions were ignored by the escort team.
------
> **Note:** Test suggests that SCP-4051's anomaly is based on how much it understands about the object? Next test should have 4051 manifest something nonexistent.

__**Experiment 4051-e-3:**__
//[A transcript has been provided to supplement the following experiment.]//
**Name:** Dr. Roswell with Dr. Edwards assisting.
**Date:** 08/17/2012
**Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a circular square, the color blue, and a statement that says it is false.
**Results:** SCP-4051 responded aggressively to the requests. Dr. Roswell attempted to negotiate with SCP-4051 to complete the test, and SCP-4051 manifested all specified items in rapid succession, creating multiple paracognitohazards, and a sheet of blue construction paper.
------
**Transcript of Experiment 4051-e-3:**
**<Begin Log>**
**Dr. Roswell:** We will now begin the third test. The purpose of this experiment will be to ascertain whether—
**SCP-4051:** When can I go home?
**Dr. Roswell:** You may return home when the Foundation determines that it no longer requires your ability for research purposes. After this test, provided no new developments occur, we will begin to investigate how your anomaly functions on a scientific level.
**SCP-4051:** Are you sure? The men who took me back to my cell weren’t.
**Dr. Roswell:** I am certain. The experiment will now—
**SCP-4051:** Please, I need to see my family. Is there any way that I can talk to them? Do they even know what happened to me?
**Dr. Roswell:** Your mother has been informed that you are engaging in a school-sanctioned college visit. Unfortunately, we can only allow communication once—
//SCP-4051 begins to pace the testing room.//
**SCP-4051:** I'm not doing any more of these experiments until my mother knows what happened to me.
**Dr. Roswell:** I can communicate your wishes to my superiors as soon as this test is completed.
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, okay. Good. Do that.
**Dr. Roswell:** The requested items are a circular square, the color blue, and a statement that says it’s false.
//A look of confusion passes over SCP-4051’s face before it rapidly manifests all three. Detrimental effects on the cognitive abilities of anyone directly observing the objects exhibited themselves immediately. SCP-4051 was immediately incapacitated by attending security personnel and returned to its containment unit.//
**<End Log>**
**Afterword:** SCP-4051 was returned to its containment unit and the testing chamber was sanitized of residual paradoxical contamination as per standard paracognitohazard protocol ψ-3.
------
> **Note:** SCP-4051 can manifest non-existent objects, apparently. Due to the effects of this experiment on Dr. Roswell, it is unlikely testing of this nature will continue. Additionally, SCP-4051’s noncompliance may prove to be an issue. I’ll send in a request for a pediatric specialist in a bit. This could be monumental in our understanding of how gateways to other dimensions are formed, and it'd be a shame to have 4051 just be another anomaly we need to keep locked in a box. Just imagine how helpful it would be if we could just use it to patch up the facility. Yeah, I'll send that request now.

**Foreword:** The following incident report describes SCP-4051's attempt to breach containment, which occurred directly after the events of Experiment-4051-e-3.
------
**16:14 -** SCP-4051 regains consciousness in its containment unit.
**16:15 -** SCP-4051 curls over onto its side as though in pain, only its back now visible to the surveillance camera in its cell.
**16:18 -** SCP-4051 begins to make slight movements with its arms.
**16:20 -** SCP-4051 stands, revealing that it has covered most of its front side in small sheets of kevlar, held together by an extremely adhesive glue. Security personnel are called for assistance at this time but are preoccupied with escorting Dr. Roswell, Dr. Edwards, and accompanying researchers from the contaminated testing chamber.
**16:21 -** SCP-4051 manifests an incendiary device and a blast-proof sheet made of unidentified material, attaching the device to the door of its containment cell and fixing the sheet over it to contain the blast. Security personnel from another wing are notified and begin moving towards SCP-4051's location.
**16:22 -** SCP-4051 detonates the device and succeeds in breaching containment. At this time, SCP-4051 also manifests an aluminum baseball bat. SCP-4051 begins moving down the hallway, opposite the direction of the testing chamber.
**16:25 -** Security personnel make contact with SCP-4051 as it rounds a corner. A fire-fight ensues. The personnel have been advised to use projectile-taser capsules for recontainment, which prove ineffective against SCP-4051's makeshift armor. Personnel are now advised to engage SCP-4051 in close-quarters combat, if possible.
**16:27 -** Two other teams of security personnel converge on SCP-4051's location, and successfully incapacitate it.

Site-17 personnel,
In light of yesterday's containment breach, SCP-4051 has been moved to an enhanced humanoid containment unit. That being said, we've concluded that it would be beneficial for Site-17 as a whole to work to better understand SCP-4051's capabilities. Multiple options are being discussed, such as using it to assist in standard repairs and maintenance, but certain influential individuals have also proposed using it to produce more valuable materials.
I'd wager that most of you don't have the clearance level to know how we produce our amnestics, but suffice it to say that the procedures range from [[[SCP-3171 |  potentially unethical]]] to [[[SCP-3000 | extremely dangerous]]] and [[[SCP-2419 | costly]]]. The Ethics Committee has taken a particular interest in SCP-4051 and are discussing using it to produce the active #Y-909 agent in amnestics. As such, Dr. Edwards has been given authority as Project Director over all experimentation and research regarding SCP-4051.
All of this can only be accomplished if SCP-4051 is compliant with Foundation procedure. Anything less than absolute dedication to the Foundation will mean that SCP-4051 is not ready to assist in our directive. To accomplish this, we will begin using standard punishments and rewards to promote good behavior, and scheduled weekly sessions with an on-site therapist, Dr. Yesenia.
All personnel assigned to directly interact with SCP-4051 have been sent a copy of the updated containment procedures and other relevant materials. Your mistake was not realizing how versatile SCP-4051's anomaly was. Let's not make that mistake again.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, Rainer! Happy to meet you.
**SCP-4051:** Oh, hi! Are you doing alright?
**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm doing well. Most of the time, I'm talking to people who just got back from a mission in the field, so having someone normal to talk with is nice.
**SCP-4051:** Eh, I'm not normal, though. That's why I'm here.
**Dr. Yesenia:** Yeah, I guess so. You can make things out of nothing, right?
**SCP-4051:** Kind of. Just small objects, like paper or food.
**Dr. Yesenia:** Or bombs?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, um...
**Dr. Yesenia:** Dude, it's alright. I get it. Containment can be hard on people. It's easier when it's an interdimensional dream witch who wants to eat your brain, but when it comes to containing good people who want to help, things tend to go south, ethically speaking. Can I ask why you wanted to escape?
**SCP-4051:** I mean, I wanted to see my family again.
**Dr. Yesenia:** There was a note about your mother in your file. I take it you were close?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, but can you keep this off the record?
**Dr. Yesenia:** Record?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, like, can you not tell the guys out there about my family?
**Dr. Yesenia:** Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
**SCP-4051:** Thank you.
**Dr. Yesenia:** You're welcome. So, you and your mother were close?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah. Goddamn, she was a fantastic woman. Sorry, //is// a fantastic woman. Dad left when I was twelve, and we've been supporting each other since.
**Dr. Yesenia:** And you miss her?
**SCP-4051:** Terribly. I wish... it doesn't matter.
**Dr. Yesenia:** I think it does. Do you want to see her again?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah. The weird thing is that I'm honestly not opposed to living in the Foundation.
**Dr. Yesenia:** You're not?
**SCP-4051:** Not really. I was actually hoping someone would come along who could help me understand my powers. Being the Foundation's lab rat doesn't bother me all that much, since at least I know I'm helping someone by sharing my ability. I guess I just wish it could be a different kind of arrangement. Am I making any sense?
**Dr. Yesenia:** That's... well, that's just not the reaction I was expecting.
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, I guess. I'm full of surprises, apparently.

__**Experiment 4051-e-4:**__
**Name:** Dr. Edwards
**Date:** 08/23/2012
**Procedure:** A D-class subject is to be introduced inside the observation chamber with SCP-4051. SCP-4051 will be instructed to manifest a small stone, and the D-class subject will attempt to remove the stone from the portal.
**Results:** SCP-4051 appeared intimidated by the D-class subject, Subject D-29543, but did not vocalize any concerns. Dr. Edwards instructed SCP-4051 to comply with the request, and Subject D-29543 was told to touch the edges of the portal before inserting his hand. Subject D-29543 made multiple explicit comments and was reminded of the consequence of unruly behavior. Subject D-29543 reported that the edges of the portal were solid, then retrieved the stone from the wormhole.
------
> **Note:** Thank God, we're getting somewhere again. It seems like SCP-4051 is only anomalous in that it can manifest the wormhole. Theoretically, if we could replicate the anomaly, we could cut out the middle man of getting it to work with us. Since we already have sufficient data on the wormhole itself, I'll try to determine how it uses its anomaly: brain scans, analyzing nerves in its arm, that kinda thing.
[[/div]]
[[div class="test"]]
__**Experiment 4051-e-5:**__
**Name:** Dr. Edwards
**Date:** 08/24/2012
**Procedure:** A mechanical arm holding a GPS tracking chip will insert the chip into SCP-4051's portal. SCP-4051 will retrieve the intended object, close the portal, and manifest the same object. Staff will determine if a signal from the tracking chip can be established.
**Results:** SCP-4051 complied with all requests and created a wormhole leading to the same framed picture of its mother as manifested in Experient-4051-e-1. The chip was inserted and was observed to hang suspended in space on the other side of the portal. When a signal from the chip was received, SCP-4051 removed the picture and allowed the wormhole to close. The signal was lost at this time. SCP-4051 again produced the portal to manifest the picture, and a signal was reestablished, but the chip was not observed; it was later confirmed to be approximately 9500 km from the wormhole.
------
> **Note:** Well, not exactly the most interesting results I could have hoped for. I'm not planning on submitting a request for more testing on the subject.
> 
> Just a small note, too, but we compared the picture it manifested today to the one it manifested in Experiment-4051-e-1. The more recent one has a few changes. The hairstyle is different and a few moles are missing on her cheeks.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Cool! Is that what you were expecting?
**SCP-4051:** Not really. I tried testing my powers on my own, just to see what I could do. Doing something like that wasn't really feasible, so... I'm excited.
**Dr. Yesenia:** I can tell. Actually, wait, do you have any requests for testing?
**SCP-4051:** I seriously doubt you can tell Dr. Edwards what I want him to do, and he'll follow through.
**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, I mean, it's unprofessional, but I want you to feel valued.
**SCP-4051:** It's fine, thank you. Dr. Edwards probably knows better than me anyways.

**Dr. Yesenia:** So, has everything else been going alright?
**SCP-4051:** Yeah, just... I keep having these dreams.
**Dr. Yesenia:** Dreams or nightmares?
**SCP-4051:** Nightmares. You're a therapist, right?
**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm pretty sure I am.
**SCP-4051:** I'm just... I don't want to seem like a freak, alright? I know that's stupid, but I'm scared of people treating me like I'm special because of what happened with my dad.
**Dr. Yesenia:** Ah, the night he left?
**SCP-4051:** You already know about it?
**Dr. Yesenia:** The Foundation compiled an extensive record on you before we brought you in.
**SCP-4051:** That makes sense. Well, if you already--
**Dr. Yesenia:** No, please. If you want to share your own experience with me, it'll be more valuable than any police report.
**SCP-4051:** When I was locked in that closet, I felt so awful, okay? I could hear him getting the bleach from the kitchen, but I couldn't break down that damn door, no matter how hard I tried. I think that's why my nightmares are all about not being able to move as something creeps closer and closer. I couldn't keep her from being hurt, and that's sticking with me, I guess.

**SCP-4051:** Yeah, I think. Yeah, it bothers me that he's out there, somewhere.

||~ Date ||~ Event Description  ||
|| 10/10/2012 || SCP-4051 performs its first routine maintenance session. The session is uneventful. ||
|| 10/18/2012 || Dr. Yesenia requests information regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. Request is denied due to Dr. Yesenia's inadequate clearance level. ||
|| 11/02/2012 || Dr. Edwards announces to Site Director Graham that Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN has produced a sufficient amount of data, such that a design for Project 350-JANUS should be proposed. ||
|| 11/07/2012 || A design for Project 350-JANUS is finalized. ||
|| 11/21/2012 || Site-17 experiences a site-wide containment breach. By chance, ██ instances of SCP-████-█ make contact with SCP-4051 while it is performing its weekly maintenance. The instances initially overwhelm attending armed personnel but are turned back by SCP-4051 when it manifests "fire", which produces a flame constantly emitting from the open wormhole. SCP-4051 is able to aim the fire at the SCP-████-█ instances and terminate ██ before attending personnel are able to incapacitate it and retreat to a safe location. ||
|| 11/28/2012 || Dr. Yesenia is ordered to verbally reprimand SCP-4051 for its unauthorized manifestation of an object during the containment breach the previous week. Dr. Yesenia complies, and SCP-4051 is not allowed to participate in any maintenance sessions for two months. ||
|| 02/07/2013 || SCP-4051 celebrates its first birthday in Foundation custody. Dr. Yesenia's original gift proposal of a treadmill, to be placed inside SCP-4051's cell for its entertainment, is rejected by Dr. Edwards. Dr. Yesenia's following proposal, a portable chess set, is accepted. ||
|| 02/28/2013 || SCP-4051 aids in the recontainment of SCP-████ from its containment unit, manifesting 20 m^^3^^ of methoxyflurane and incapacitating it. ||
|| 03/03/2013 || A prototype of Project 350-JANUS is constructed. Testing confirms that the device is non-operational. Dr. Edwards is informed of the need for more data regarding SCP-4051's anomaly. ||
|| 03/04/2013 || Dr. Edwards requests a replacement of the incision tool used in Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN, which had become extensively damaged by unknown means. ||
|| 04/10/2013 || Project 350-JANUS continues to produce ████████████ instead of the requested object. Dr. Edwards is given full control over the project to ensure its success. ||
|| 04/12/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests a review by the Ethics Committee regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. The request is denied. ||
|| 04/27/2013 || During a standard weekly maintenance session, SCP-4051 is hurt by a falling lead beam. Attending personnel request medical attention, and SCP-4051 asks permission to manifest various bandages for its wound. The request is granted. ||
|| 05/16/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests access to SCP-4051's medical file and is reminded of her inadequate clearance level. The request is denied. ||
|| 05/23/2013 || [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE] ||
|| 05/25/2013 || Project 350-JANUS successfully manifests a requested object. The machine malfunctions immediately after the manifestation, rendering it non-operable. ||

**MEMO TO THE OFFICE OF THE SITE-17 DIRECTOR**
**From:** Dr. Yesenia, assigned to [[[SCP-4051]]] as an onsite therapist.

------

Graham,

It's been some time since I've received a formal update from you regarding SCP-4051. Despite my best efforts to acquire anything of substance related to the work Dr. Edwards is doing on him, all my attempts have led to failure.

I am not asking for a higher clearance level. I am attempting to provide you with some advice. I have my suspicions about the nature of Project 350-JANUS, and what you're trying to accomplish, but whatever it is, it's evidently important to your superiors. Due to the time it has taken to develop the project, I can only imagine that you're receiving significant push-back from them. Although I cannot help with the development of the project, I have a proposal for you.

SCP-4051 has a remarkable desire to help. His aid in site maintenance has doubtlessly alleviated some of your financial concerns, and he has proven to be resourceful, as well as capable and eager to help the Foundation.

If you want to get your superiors off your back, I'd recommend showing them these traits. Explain Rainer to them in a way they'll understand: prove he is a valuable asset to Site-17 by having him engage in the recovery of a low-threat anomaly. Rainer's ability grants him a versatility that humans do not possess. If you throw him underwater, he can create a breathing apparatus at will. If a member of his team is wounded, he can provide immediate medical support.

I want to be clear here. As someone with a connection with him, I have a certain bias. I want him to be freer, happier. But consider the idea that allowing him to support the Foundation in a more active role will be advantageous to you, the Foundation at large, and the people giving Dr. Edwards the money he needs to continue his experimentation.

**P-7 Rainer:** Good over here.

**S-3 Morgan:** Resident Type Blue present. We heading in now?

**SiteCommand:** Affirmative.

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, we have some graffiti on the walls here.

**SiteCommand:** Noted. Filters aren't catching any memetics, so you should be fine.

**S-3 Morgan:** There are some thaumaturgical symbols here. Looks like variations on... well, they should be misdirecting and hiding something.

**P-7 Rainer:** So there could be something in the room we can't see?

**S-3 Morgan:** Command, are you guys catching anything like that?

**SiteCommand:** Negative, Morgan.

**S-3 Morgan:** Okay, then the symbols are probably meant for people passing by the building on the street. They're not hiding it from view, more... making it unremarkable.

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, this room is clear. Entering the next one.

**SiteCommand:** Understood.

//(Team enters the adjacent room. The room has more garbage on the floor than the last.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** Morgan, anything different with the graffiti here?

**S-3 Morgan:** Not that I can see. More runes to misdirect the unsuspecting.

//(Team searches the items on the floor for two minutes.)//

**P-7 Charlie:** This room seems clear. Our anomaly should be on another floor.

**P-7 Rainer:** Hey, I read the file report, but what exactly are we supposed to be looking for?

**P-7 Rico:** The reports we got suggest that this place has some extradimensional abnormality. We'll be getting close when the symbols on the walls start changing.

**P-7 Charlie:** Alright team, moving out now. Morgan, let us know if you see anything.

//(Team enters a stairwell and begins traveling downwards. Morgan pauses.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** New symbols. That one up ahead has a serif that imbues it with the power to harm.

**P-7 Jayla:** Meaning?

**S-3 Morgan:** The people who were using this building didn't want the uninvited to enter, so they set up defensive mechanisms on the walls to discourage non-magic users. Let's see, there should be some prerequisite... right, that one up ahead means "Potential".

**P-7 Rainer:** That's what the Hand calls magical capability, right?

**S-3 Morgan:** Yeah, although... did they give you the same pre-mission materials as us?

**P-7 Rainer:** I think so. They gave me an amnestic and told me that after two hours I wouldn't remember anything I'd read.

**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, how do we proceed?

**S-3 Morgan:** Go ahead and blow out the sections of wall with the runes. They were probably just trying to keep homeless people and teenagers out of here.

**P-7 Charlie:** Alright, Jayla, get--

**SiteCommand:** Charlie, you hear me?

**P-7 Charlie:** I do. Do you advise against using incendiaries?

**SiteCommand:** Let Rainer assist in detonation. We're using this mission as a sort of trial run.

**P-7 Charlie:** Right. Rainer, manifest two charges. We'll attach and detonate them.

//(P-7 Rainer complies and the team detonates the charges.)//

**P-7 Trevor:** Hey, Jayla, this kid keeps it up and you'll be out of a job.

**S-3 Morgan:** You all should be able to proceed now.

//(Team enters the first sublevel. The room they enter has less graffiti on the walls, although more thaumaturgical symbols are present.)//

**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, what are we looking at?

**S-3 Morgan:** A bunch of enhancement runes. One of those makes materials harder to break, another boosts perception, another makes you move faster. Anyone feeling those effects?

**P-7 Rico:** Negative.

**P-7 Rainer:** Not me.

**P-7 Charlie:** Nope.

**P-7 Jayla:** No.

**P-7 Trevor:** Not that I can feel.

**S-3 Morgan:** The serifs over the runes seem to mean it's targeting a specific entity or type of entity.

**P-7 Trevor:** Did the reports say anything about this place besides the symbols visible from the outside and the homeless guy talking about going to the other dimension?

**P-7 Charlie:** No, they didn't. Command, did you read anything with a thermal scan of the building?

**SiteCommand:** Negative.

**P-7 Charlie:** Jayla, clear this room for us. We'll scout the adjacent rooms and determine if there's another entity here.

**P-7 Jayla:** Is the kid staying with me?

**P-7 Charlie:** He's coming with us. Graham probably wants us to test how he does under pressure.

//(P-7 Jayla remains in the room while the rest of the team clears the remaining rooms on the floor. Extraneous ten minutes of dialogue removed from transcript. P-7 Rico enters the final room, which has a frameless mirror leaning against the back wall.)//

**P-7 Rico:** Hey, got something here, boss.

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, Rico has found a mirror that seems mostly intact.

**SiteCommand:** You have permission to engage and determine if it's anomalous.

**P-7 Charlie:** Understood.

//(P-7 Charlie presses a hand against the glass. His reflection is seen to stare directly at him, while P-7 Charlie is directly observing the surface he is touching. P-7 Charlie unexpectedly applies pressure to the mirror, and his reflection is observed to buckle its arm with a surprised expression before walking out of view.)//

**P-7 Trevor:** Well, fuck that.

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, we have a confirmed anomalous object. Is this the portal we’re looking for?

**SiteCommand:** That’s not likely. Continue to the second sublevel.

**P-7 Charlie:** Understood. Jayla, we’re coming back to you and entering the next floor.

**P-7 Jayla:** Understood.

//(Team regroups and enters the staircase. Sounds of an unknown entity shuffling on the second sublevel are heard from the staircase. Team halts.)//

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, advise.

**SiteCommand:** Proceed.

**P-7 Charlie:** Everyone, weapons ready. Rainer, get in the back.

//(P-7 Charlie enters the second sublevel from the stairwell and performs a visual scan of the room. No entity is confirmed, although detection is made difficult due to the darkness. The walls and floor are free of graffiti and litter.)//

//(P-7 Charlie signals for the rest of the team to proceed and activate their shoulder-mounted lights. The team approaches the only doorway, and a loud screech is heard before a creature travels extremely quickly past the doorway from the adjacent hallway. The creature is approximately one meter in height, two meters in length, and resembles an arachnid. The head of the creature is ostensibly a hairless humanoid, disregarding the lack of discernible eyes or comparable organs.)//

//(The team retreats to the entrance of the stairwell.)//

**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, what’s the likelihood that the runes upstairs apply to that thing?

**S-3 Morgan:** Very high. Its speed, perception, and durability have been augmented.

**P-7 Trevor:** Define “durability”.

**S-3 Morgan:** Physical force won’t do much damage to it. That means bullets are essentially useless.

**P-7 Trevor:** Hell yeah.

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, did the report say that this floor is just this room, a hallway, and a large central room?

**SiteCommand:** That should be the case.

**P-7 Charlie:** Our goal is to get into that central room. There should be an entrance in the hallway, so we need a way to clear out the spiders. Trevor, you want to help with that?

**P-7 Trevor:** You know I do.

//(The team enters the hallway, with P-7 Rico observing the south end of the hallway for hostile entities while P-7 Charlie observes the north end. Turns to the east are visible in both directions at the ends of the hallway. The team proceeds to the north for approximately five meters before P-7 Rico sights an entity turning from the eastern hall and proceeding towards them.)//

**P-7 Rico:** Trevor, we got one in my direction, coming in fast!

//(P-7 Trevor turns towards the entity and uses his supplied flamethrower. The entity is engulfed in flame and emits a loud shriek before the flames abate, revealing its charred corpse. Several shrieks are also heard from elsewhere in the building along with rapid shuffling, converging on the team’s location.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** Shit, Trevor, cover that end, we’ll slow ours down with bullets.

**P-7 Charlie:** Rainer, use your flamethrower and cover us on this end while we move down the hallway.

**P-7 Rainer:** Understood.

//(The team moves north and is met with resistance by the entities. Three approach from the south towards P-7 Trevor and are promptly dispatched. Two approach from the north, and are incapacitated by P-7 Rainer after P-7 Charlie, P-7 Jayla, and S-3 Morgan deter the entities with conventional firearms.)//

//(The team turns at the corner and dispatch five more entities before coming to an entrance to the central room. The walls of the room are covered in thaumaturgical symbols, and a large circular pattern of an unidentified red liquid is present on the floor.)//

**P-7 Trevor:** Shit, did we kill them all? I was just starting to have some fun.

**P-7 Charlie:** Trevor, quiet.

//(P-7 Charlie’s shoulder-mounted light illuminates a child huddled in the corner of the room. It appears to be female and clothed in a thin, white dress.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Shit...

**P-7 Charlie:** Command, did the report mention anything about cult activity in this building?

**SiteCommand:** Negative.

**P-7 Jayla:** May I approach?

**P-7 Charlie:** Go ahead.

//(P-7 Jayla switches off her shoulder-mounted light and approaches the child, lowering herself to be eye-to-eye with it. The child appears to have various injuries and cuts on its arms and legs.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** Hey, you alright?

//(The child does not respond, but raises its head to look at P-7 Jayla.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** Do you know how you got here?

**Child:** I was in a library.

**P-7 Jayla:** Oh? Where?

**Child:** [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | A far-away place, and yet, so close.]]]

**P-7 Jayla:** Um...

**P-7 Rico:** Charlie, just a reminder that this is definitely some demon shit.

**Child:** I was cast out. Kept a prisoner from knowledge. Left to lurk in the darkened places beneath those holy shelves.

//(The child begins to stand but is stopped by P-7 Jayla when she aims her firearm at the child’s forehead.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** I wouldn’t do that if I were you, sweetie.

**Child:** You cannot harm me more than they did. Even if your bullets could pierce me, it would be nothing compared to the agony I felt underneath the stone.

**P-7 Charlie:** Jayla, take the shot.

//(P-7 Jayla fires a single round at the child’s forehead. It stumbles back before emitting a screech, and its body begins to be disfigured as it transforms into an arachnid, similar to the entities encountered previously. Its new form measures roughly five meters in length and height. P-7 Jayla is consequentially knocked back and pinned beneath it as it writhes on the ground.)//

**P-7 Jayla:** Shit, get it off me!

//(The team engages with the entity for roughly ten seconds as it regains its balance. Bullets have little effect, and the flames produced by P-7 Trevor and P-7 Rainer appear to cause pain, but do not deter the entity. It lifts itself up and uses its mouth to grab hold of P-7 Jayla’s right leg, breaking it in the process. It drags P-7 Jayla to the center of the circular pattern and begins to mutilate her legs, causing P-7 Jayla to lose consciousness. At this time, the thaumaturgical symbols present on the walls are seen to glow softly, and the floor contained by the circular pattern begins to dematerialize. After five seconds, the floor becomes a portal into an unknown location, with dirty brick walls and floor of a tunnel visible. P-7 Jayla and the entity fall through the portal.)//

**P-7 Trevor:** Shit! Jayla!

**P-7 Rico:** We’ve got company!

//(Twenty smaller arachnid entities emerge from the hallway behind the team. Despite P-7 Trevor’s usage of his flamethrower and S-3 Morgan’s usage of their thaumaturgical ability, incapacitating ten of the twenty arachnids, the team is overwhelmed. S-3 Morgan, P-7 Trevor, P-7 Charlie, and P-7 Rico are dragged by five of the entities into the portal, and P-7 Rainer successfully terminates the remaining five with his makeshift flamethrower.)//

//(At this time, SiteCommand's connection with the rest of the team is intermittently lost and reestablished.)//

**SiteCommand:** Rainer, can you hear me?

**P-7 Rainer:** I can. Shit, what the hell?

**SiteCommand:** How were you able to terminate the remaining entities without aid?

**P-7 Rainer:** I, um... I memorized the symbols that we saw upstairs. And then I manifested a few strips of tape with the symbols inscribed on them and put them on my suit. So... speed, perception, misdirection... what was the other one?

**SiteCommand:** Rainer, is the portal still open?

**P-7 Rainer:** Yeah, it is. I'm seeing a brick tunnel. It's real dark down there.

**SiteCommand:** Abort the mission. Return to the back door of the building immediately and wait for retrieval.

**P-7 Rainer:** Do I... do I have to?

**SiteCommand:** Yes, you have to. Failure to comply will result in--

**P-7 Rainer:** Um, listen, I'm going in. That's what a hero does, right? He disobeys his superiors to save the day?

**SiteCommand:** Disobedience will almost certainly mean that you'll never be selected for another mission.

**P-7 Rainer:** I know, but... they can't have gone far. At the very least, I can try to explore that other place for you guys.

//(SiteCommand's connection with P-7 Rainer is lost as he enters the portal. A support team composed of additional members from MTF Psi-7 is requested for retrieval. Connection is reestablished after thirty seconds.)//

//(P-7 Rainer is seen running down the brick tunnel, using his shoulder-mounted light to illuminate the area in front of him.)//

**SiteCommand:** Connection reestablished. Rainer, where are you?

**P-7 Rainer:** One of them is up ahead. I can hear it dragging... shit, is that Morgan? Hey!

//(P-7 Rainer's shoulder-mounted light illuminates an Aleph-Order semi-physical entity//[[footnote]] From //Dr. Harkov's Guide to Classifying Semi-Physical Entities, 1998 Anniversary Edition//: "'Aleph-Order' is a designation given to an entity which is both non-physical and capable of interacting with the physical world. Aleph-Order entities differ from Hazma-Order entities in their ability to deconstruct physical objects, while Hazma-Order entities can only exert simple 'pushing and pulling' forces.[[/footnote]] //lifting S-3 Morgan and pushing them against the wall of the tunnel. S-3 Morgan's body appears to be merging with the brick structure of the wall, causing them extreme pain, but they are unable to vocalize it for unknown reasons. Two halves of the corpse of an arachnid entity are present farther down the tunnel.)//

//(P-7 Rainer removes his provided firearm and fires five rounds at the entity. None of the bullets appear to strike the entity, although three pass through space it occupies. The entity turns its head from S-3 Morgan and approaches P-7 Rainer, leaving S-3 Morgan suspended inside the wall. P-7 Rainer manifests "fire" and aims the flamethrower towards the entity, who does not appear burned but recoils regardless. Its form appears to be disrupted by the light from the flames.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Morgan, close your eyes!

//(S-3 Morgan is unable to respond but shuts their eyes, turning their head away from P-7 Rainer. P-7 Rainer manifests another object, creating a bright flash in the tunnel and temporarily disabling video. After the effects of the flash abate, the entity is not observed and is presumed to have either demanifested or been terminated.)//

**SiteCommand:** Video has been reestablished.

**S-3 Morgan:** Command?

**SiteCommand:** Morgan, can you extricate yourself from the wall?

**S-3 Morgan:** Fuck no. It's like my arm and the wall are the same thing.

//(SiteCommand discusses options for S-3 Morgan's retrieval as P-7 Rainer gives medical attention to their other injuries.)//

**SiteCommand:** Morgan, would you consent to removing the arm entirely?

**S-3 Morgan:** Over what? Waiting for another team to get here? Fuck that.

**P-7 Rainer:** Do you want me to do the procedure?

**SiteCommand:** Manifest a "laser" and test it on the arachnid corpse near you.

//(P-7 Rainer complies. The manifested portal produces a bright red beam that cleaves the flesh of the arachnid and immediately cauterizes the inflicted wound.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Right, um, this should be quick. Do you want something to--

**S-3 Morgan:** Go ahead and do it. I'll be fine.

//(P-7 Rainer again manifests a laser and successfully detaches S-3 Morgan's arm from their shoulder. The shoulder is cauterized, and S-3 Morgan expresses extreme pain.)//

**SiteCommand:** Rainer, manifest painkillers. The variety referenced in your pre-mission materials, preferably.

//(P-7 Rainer complies and administers the painkillers to S-3 Morgan. S-3 Morgan vocalizes extreme discomfort and pain for another sixty seconds.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Jesus... okay, it's better now.

**P-7 Rainer:** Do you have any other injuries?

**S-3 Morgan:** Honestly? After that, I don't think anything's going to feel painful again.

**P-7 Rainer:** Alright. Do you want to leave and re-enter the building through the portal, or continue down the tunnel?

**S-3 Morgan:** Command, are you sending in a rescue team?

**SiteCommand:** The team has been assembled and is currently en route to the building. It would cut down on potential complications if you would--

**S-3 Morgan:** Great. Tell them Rainer and I are going further into the tunnel, after the rest of our team.

**SiteCommand:** Do you have any particular justification for this egregious breach of protocol?

**S-3 Morgan:** Eh... yeah. I'd prefer to keep it to myself, though.

**SiteCommand:** I'll put your preference down on record, but I doubt that will be sufficient enough for anyone reviewing your behavior post-mission.

**S-3 Morgan:** Listen, I'm ex-Hand. I wasn't particularly knowledgable about the Wanderers' Library when I was active, but I knew some stuff. The Foundation is currently barred from accessing the Library, which is pretty standard procedure for undesirable groups. That spider thing that carried off Charlie and the rest is worse than the Foundation, as far as the Library's concerned.

**SiteCommand:** Can you give me a simple reason for this protocol breach?

**S-3 Morgan:** Right, sure. That thing is attempting to break back into the Library, and I need to stop it. Put it under, uh... "Protection of noncombatants."

**SiteCommand:** Noted.

**S-3 Morgan:** Alright kid, you ever fucked with magic before?

**P-7 Rainer:** I haven't. Can you walk?

**S-3 Morgan:** Give me a hand and we'll see.

//(P-7 Rainer assists S-3 Morgan in standing.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Command, uh... right, adrenaline is coming down.

//(P-7 Rainer begins to support S-3 Morgan as they walk down the tunnel.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** There's a fork up ahead. I saw the spiders take the rest of the team to the right.

**P-7 Rainer:** Understood. Are you feeling any better?

**S-3 Morgan:** I am.

**P-7 Rainer:** Just, if it gets painful, think about the opposite of the pain.

**S-3 Morgan:** The opposite?

**P-7 Rainer:** It helps more than just thinking about the pain being gone. Think of it more like pain's inverse, I guess. That doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry.

//(Both are silent for several seconds.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Did you receive that scar during the fight?

**P-7 Rainer:** The one on my arm?

**S-3 Morgan:** Yes. I saw it before you manifested the light to kill the thing attacking me.

**P-7 Rainer:** No, I got this before.

**S-3 Morgan:** I think I can fix that with my thaumaturgy. Err... I //could// have fixed it. I guess being a Type Blue with one arm is going to be difficult.

**P-7 Rainer:** What's it like, being a magician?

**S-3 Morgan:** Great, at first. You feel like you're on top of the world. Then someone finds out. You ask them to keep it quiet, but of course they don't. You go to the Library because where else can you go?

**P-7 Rainer:** Was it lonely in the Library?

**S-3 Morgan:** Alone and without a book to read, yes. It's dreadful. You can see others around you, imbibing a universe of knowledge, being happy and free among the shelves, but you're trapped with your own self-doubt. It's like coming out as nonbinary all over... hold on.

//(Both stay still as they observe the fork in the tunnel. Two entities are present to the right turn. One appears to be a floating, tattered cloak, obscuring the wearer from view. The other's form is unobservable, due to several localized reality distortions surrounding it, but appears to be somewhat humanoid. The two entities are engaging in hostilities with one another.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** We'll have to pass these two if we want to follow the team. I recognize the Shroud from the Library, before it was banished. It has a particular distaste for the written word and seeks to absorb literature into the oblivion beneath its fabric.

**P-7 Rainer:** And the other?

**S-3 Morgan:** I can't be certain. I've read about it in the Library, but... well, I haven't entered the Library for a long time. I believe it's an entity that... "rewrites" reality. Both presented a high-level threat to the knowledge contained by the Library and were subsequently sent here.

**P-7 Rainer:** Any advice for combat?

**S-3 Morgan:** Physical force won't be particularly effective. I'd recommend letting me use my thaumaturgy, but I'll be a bit slower with my blue-spells than usual. We either have... what are those things on your suit?

**P-7 Rainer:** Strips of duct tape. I manifested them so that the runes we saw on the upper floors were inscribed into them.

**S-3 Morgan:** ...

**P-7 Rainer:** Is that bad?

**S-3 Morgan:** It's... inventive. Our goal should be to pass them without being noticed. Unfortunately, that means waiting until they start to fight. Command, how soon until that second team reaches the building?

**SiteCommand:** Approximately five minutes.

**S-3 Morgan:** Understood. You ready, Rainer?

**P-7 Rainer:** I am.

//(The two observe as the entities circle each other until the shrouded figure reaches to open its robe. Several isolated spacial distortions form around the shrouded figure but are abruptly nullified when it removes the front section of cloth. The second entity reacts aggressively to this, appearing to phase from the visible light spectrum before several thaumaturgical symbols are observed on the fabric of the cloaked figure. The symbols glow red, and the shrouded figure acts agitated and removes the robe entirely, discarding it. The discarded shroud is surrounded in an explosion, destroying a section of the wall close to S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Alright, sprint as quickly as you can.

//(P-7 Rainer assists S-3 Morgan as they run through the tunnel. As they pass the entities, both take notice of them but appear unwilling to pursue. P-7 Rainer and S-3 Morgan run for three more seconds before a shriek is heard, presumably emanating from the previously cloaked figure.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** The Shroud is about to absorb us.

**P-7 Rainer:** It's about to what?

//(A loud sound echoes through the tunnel as an unseen force is seen pulling S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer towards the two entities as S-3 Morgan attempts to use their thaumaturgical ability to cancel the effect. Both are pulled backward along the tunnel floor, and the previously cloaked entity is observed. It appears to be a mass of corporeal, black tendrils.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Morgan! The fuck do we do?

**S-3 Morgan:** Hold on to my arm if you can.

**P-7 Rainer:** Shit! Shit!

//(S-3 Morgan is unable to resist the unseen force due to their previously sustained injuries, and is pulled rapidly towards the entity. P-7 Rainer reacts by letting go of his hold on the brick floor and manifesting a portal while in mid-air. The manifested object is inconsistent in form but appears to be a series of white tendrils, shifting in and out of the visible spectrum. The manifested object approaches the entity at a faster rate than either S-3 Morgan or P-7 Rainer, and upon making contact with the entity, disappears. The hostile entity, likewise, cannot be located. S-3 Morgan falls to the ground, otherwise unharmed. Both are silent for several seconds.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Kid, what the hell was that?

**P-7 Rainer:** I-I panicked. I saw that it was about to get you, and... I thought about how much I didn't want it to be there, and... shit! Look out!

//(Several localized spatial distortions appear around P-7 Rainer's body, resulting in loss of audio and video connection to SiteCommand. S-3 Morgan's video is likewise affected, but audio indicates that S-3 Morgan dispelled the remaining entity after a few seconds.)//

**SiteCommand:** Connection has been reestablished.

**S-3 Morgan:** I read you, Command. Kid, you alright?

//(P-7 Rainer vocalizes extreme distress and sounds as though he is holding back tears.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Did I kill that guy, Morgan?

**S-3 Morgan:** It wasn't human. It was an aberration whose existence was dedicated to the destruction of knowledge.

**P-7 Rainer:** I manifested... oh god, I manifested the exact opposite of it. In space and matter. It must have canceled out with the real thing, and now they just don't exist.

**S-3 Morgan:** Command, I've changed my mind, and I'm aborting the mission. Knowing Charlie, he's already managed to kill the arachnid.

**SiteCommand:** Denied, Morgan.

**S-3 Morgan:** What?

**SiteCommand:** Dr. Edwards is currently viewing the video of this exploration and has made it very clear that the operation should continue.

//(P-7 Rainer visibly flinches at the mention of Dr. Edwards.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** And I'm supposed to listen to some researcher sitting safe and sound in Site-17?

**SiteCommand:** Dr. Edwards is the current Director for the SCP-4051 project, and has been given authority over this operation by Site Director Graham.

//(S-3 Morgan silently deliberates for several seconds before turning to P-7 Rainer.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Can you stand?

**P-7 Rainer:** Yes.

**S-3 Morgan:** We're continuing the mission. We shouldn't be too far from the rest of the team. Stay behind me.

**P-7 Rainer:** Understood.

//(The two continue down the tunnel in silence. After four minutes of walking, both audio devices detect sounds of a struggle echoing from farther down the tunnel.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Kid, uh, you alright?

**P-7 Rainer:** I'm fine. Are you?

**S-3 Morgan:** Yes. How did you get the scar on your arm?

**P-7 Rainer:** I don't want to say.

**S-3 Morgan:** Why's that?

**P-7 Rainer:** I just don't.

//(There is silence for one minute.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** I messed it up in a containment breach. They sometimes let me out to help around the site, and an anomaly got out during one of my sessions. Big thing, lots of claws. Scratched my arm before the guards took it out.

**S-3 Morgan:** Alright. Sorry you had to go through that.

**P-7 Rainer:** Me too.

//(Several tremors shake the section of the tunnel.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** We should hurry.

//(S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer sprint down the tunnel. As they do, the walls of the tunnel begin to undergo spatial manipulation, elongating and contracting repeatedly.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** We have company.

**S-3 Morgan:** Get behind me.

//(The spatial manipulation intensifies in a particular area of the floor, as the head of a large anomalous entity emerges from the brick. The entity appears to be humanoid and continues to rise until its form occupies the entirety of the tunnel. Its body is roughly twenty meters in height, requiring the walls and ceiling to warp around it. Its skin appears to be pure white, with several unknown runes and designs marked in a black substance along its forearms and chest.)//

**Unknown Entity:** A hundred chains to bind me, a hundred more before me.

**S-3 Morgan:** Your path so far removed, must you tarry long?

**Unknown Entity:** I come as a preventer of misfortune. The one behind you is shadowed in doubt, a thing I have known well. A granter of wishes, I was, in another life; a slave to others by nature, all come undone when one spoke the fell words, "I wish for the destruction of the Wanderer's Library." In this purgation, I sensed a kindred soul.

**S-3 Morgan:** Your purgation is not yet complete, your powers still beyond you. You may not prevent our passing.

**P-7 Rainer:** I see no comparison between you and I.[[footnote]] It is currently unknown if SCP-4051 spoke in this manner due to an anomalous compulsive effect. [[/footnote]]

**S-3 Morgan:** Rainer, be quiet.

**Unknown Entity:** A free man, you see yourself? You who are entangled in bindings, both physical and mental?

**P-7 Rainer:** I, who am--

**S-3 Morgan:** //[Speech is unintelligible due to low volume.]//

//(Multiple thaumaturgical symbols manifest around P-7 Rainer's head, silencing him. The entity's eyes glow and it leans towards P-7 Rainer, appearing to manipulate the runes with its fingers. The runes glow, and dissipate before reappearing around S-3 Morgan, effectively paralyzing them.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** I, who am free, know my own nature.

**Unknown Entity:** You are crippled by doubt. Your mind is a boiling sea of indecision.

**P-7 Rainer:** And I am free to make it thus.

**Unknown Entity:** You are wrong. A foreign binding compels your hand.

//(The entity begins to reach for P-7 Rainer, but is repelled when P-7 Rainer manifests "fire". It retracts its hand and returns to a standing position, the black runes on its skin beginning to glow red.)//

**Unknown Entity:** In my eternal perdition, I seek redemption for a crime not my own. I cannot allow a kinder spirit to suffer as I have.

//(Reality begins to distort around P-7 Rainer's location, and video connection is lost. S-3 Morgan is released from their magically-induced paralysis and immediately fires at the entity, who has begun to destabilize. The entity is unaffected and disperses its physical form into the localized reality distortion surrounding P-7 Rainer. P-7 Rainer vocalizes acute distress and pain.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** I //[unintelligible]// slave. //[unintelligible]// need them. I can't //[unintelligible]//.

//(The distorted space appears to fluctuate, and S-3 Morgan retreats to a safe distance.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** I will not be your slave as well! //[unintelligible]//

**S-3 Morgan:** Command, I need advice here!

**SiteCommand:** Working on it.

//(Several tremors shake the tunnel, and P-7 Rainer vocalizes extreme pain. The fluctuations of the distortion increase, and the walls of the tunnel begin to undergo rapid contraction and expansion.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** I need an answer now!

//(A circle of unidentifiable runes surrounds the floor around P-7 Rainer, appearing to glow and emit sparks of white lightning, which strike the distorted space from all sides. Sections of the walls close to P-7 Rainer disintegrate, causing unknown damage to the tunnel's structural integrity.)//

**SiteCommand:** Initiating emergency activation of P-7 Rainer's Type-S "Slow Burn" amnestic in 3, 2, 1.

//(At this time, all anomalous phenomena surrounding P-7 Rainer cease, and P-7 Rainer falls to the ground, unconscious.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** How long will he be like this?

**SiteCommand:** Acclimation takes roughly--

//(Abruptly, P-7 Rainer regains consciousness and immediately stands, apparently only moderately impeded by residual effects of the amnestic, and begins to sprint down the tunnel.)//

**S-3 Morgan:** Rainer, wait!

//(S-3 Morgan is unable to match P-7 Rainer's pace, and soon falls behind.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Get out of my head, get out of my head!

//(P-7 Rainer manifests an object, and all brick walls within a 30-meter radius of him abruptly disintegrate. A path is revealed, and a large arachnid creature is seen at the end, before disappearing from view.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** I've got you now!

//(P-7 Rainer's pace increases until he enters a large chamber at the end of the path. The chamber is composed entirely of brick and is several stories tall. Inside the chamber, P-7 Rico, P-7 Trevor, and P-7 Charlie are seen engaging the arachnid creature. On the floor, an elaborate design of red liquid has been created, with the body of P-7 Jayla in the center. Letters of various known and unknown languages manifest from the border of the design.)//

**P-7 Trevor:** Rainer! What the fuck happened to you?

//(P-7 Rainer screams as the massive, humanoid entity reforms above the group, standing suspended in the chamber. Its eyes begin to glow as it looks down on all of them.)//

**P-7 Rainer:** Take this!

**<Begin Log>**

**Dr. Yesenia:** Rainer? Can you hear me?

**SCP-4051:** Oh! Dr. Yesenia! How are you?

**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm doing well. How about you?

**SCP-4051:** I'm doing great! I just got back from a mission.

**Dr. Yesenia:** Oh? Tell me about it.

**SCP-4051:** I helped a lot of people. Fought a spider. Saved Jayla and Trevor and Rico. And I found out more about my anomaly!

**Dr. Yesenia:** Oh? You did?

**SCP-4051:** Yeah! I can get rid of things by making their opposite. Walls, enemies, monsters. Maybe when I'm doing maintenance, I can clean out--

**Dr. Yesenia:** Rainer, your maintenance sessions have been indefinitely canceled.

**SCP-4051:** They've... they've what?

**Dr. Yesenia:** We can no longer allow you to exit your containment unit, due to the threat you now present to the Foundation at large, and the world.

//(SCP-4051 is silent for several seconds, before standing and beginning to pace the room, nodding repeatedly.)//

**SCP-4051:** That makes sense. It makes sense. I'm sorry.

**Dr. Yesenia:** You don't need to be sorry for anything.

**SCP-4051:** Can I still help you?

//(There are several seconds of silence.)//

**Dr. Yesenia:** You help us just by being here, Rainer.

**SCP-4051:** I do?

**Dr. Yesenia:** Yes, you do. But more importantly, you... you need us.

**SCP-4051:** Oh, I know that. I need you. I know that. I... Thank you for caring for me.

**Dr. Yesenia:** You're welcome, Rainer. Goodbye for now.

**SCP-4051:** Goodbye, Dr. Yesenia!

//(SCP-4051 sits in the corner of its room and smiles, and remains there.)//

What follows is the unofficial report on the incident involving SCP-4051, the anomalous object placed under your care by Ethics Committee liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian.

On 18 July 2013, 1500 hours, a joint mobile task force, composed primarily of members of MTF Psi-7 ("Home Improvement"), but also [[[SCP-4051]]] and a single member of MTF Sigma-3 ("Bibliographers"), entered an anomalous location in Chicago, Illinois. During the exploration, the team unintentionally entered an extradimensional space located beneath the Wanderer's Library. All members of the team, except SCP-4051 — who entered voluntarily — were forced into the portal.

While a secondary retrieval team was being prepped, SCP-4051's Slow Burn amnestic was activated prematurely in an attempt to expel a hostile entity from its mind. Doing this resulted in a near-complete collapse of SCP-4051's mental stability, and it revealed that it now could manifest the "inverse" of any given object that it could adequately "picture", giving it the ability to destroy any matter it can comprehend. It utilized this ability to destroy a large section of the extra-dimensional space, neutralizing the hostile arachnid entity as well as the humanoid entity which had entered its mind. The secondary retrieval team reported a massive crater, roughly 100 meters in diameter, with SCP-4051 at the center. SCP-4051 did not resist being incapacitated.

Below are the official statuses of all operatives involved in the initial exploration effort.

**TL P-7 Charlie:** Alive, currently deployed at another location.
**P-7 Trevor:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in two weeks.
**P-7 Rico:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in one week.
**P-7 Jayla:** Killed in action.
**S-3 Morgan:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in three weeks.
**SCP-4051:** [[[Recruitment Drive | Contained.]]]

This incident has resulted in the immediate reclassification of SCP-4051 to Keter, and its current containment cell is being outfitted with preventative measures, should it attempt to breach containment. The Special Containment Procedures need to be updated, as well as all relevant staff briefed on the new situation we're facing.

Naturally, the official report on this incident will read differently. In terms of the repercussions of this, I'm expecting an immediate review of all procedures and projects related to SCP-4051 by an Ethics Committee that is no longer willing to turn a blind eye [[[SCP-4415 | for the greater good]]]. I'm sorry, Edwards. I can no longer protect you.

I'm sorry about what SCP-4051 did to your brother. Dr. Roswell was one of the finest researchers we had at this site. I know we've all grieved, and found different methods of doing it, you included.

Have a good life, Edwards.

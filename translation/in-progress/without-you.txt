##red|Rosa woke from her sleep in a cold sweat. Her breath hitched and her eyes widened as she struggled to find her phone. Tears welled in her eyes as she curled into a ball, clutching her knees. Her heart pounded in her aching chest, leaving her feeling weak. The spot next to her was cold and messy. Untouched since Kassidy had disappeared two days ago. Shivers ran down Rosa’s spine as she pulled one of Kassidy’s pillows to her. It still smelled like them. ##
ローザは冷たい汗に包まれて眠りから目覚めた。電話を見つけようと苦労していると息は上がり眼もより大きく開かれた。足首を掴んでボールのように彼女は丸まり、眼からは涙が湧き上がってきた。痛む胸中で心臓が鳴り響いて、彼女は脱力感に包まれていた。彼女の隣の場所は冷え切っていて散らかっていた。2日前にカシディが失踪してから触れていないままだ。ローザの背筋を悪寒が走り、カシディの枕のうちから1つを引き寄せた。その人の残り香がまだあった。
##red|Time was slow for Rosa, ever since she had found the note that now haunted her dreams. Rosa wasn’t an idiot, she knew there was little hope of her spouse coming back. But every time her mind had run into that topic it sent a heavy ache through her body. One she couldn’t shake off anymore. ##
今や悪夢を見せるようになったメモを見つけた時から、ローザの時の進みは遅くなった。ローザも馬鹿ではなく、彼女の伴侶が戻ってくる希望などほとんどないとは解っていた。だが、その点について心が考え至る度に、身体に激しい痛みが走るのだ。もう彼女には跳ね除けることなどできなかった。
##red|Pins and needles pricked her hands and feet, fingers and toes felt like curling into themselves. Rosa sobbed, continuing to clutch the pillow to her body. Everything had seemed so perfect, like nothing could go wrong. Yet, the unthinkable happened, and Rosa would give anything to go back and just hold Kassidy a little bit longer. Memories of giggling after dark and cuddling filled Rosa’s mind. ##
ピンと針に彼女の手足を引っ掻かれているかのように、手指と足趾を丸め込む。ローザは泣いて枕をギュゥッと抱きしめ続けた。かつて何もかもがとても完璧なように、あたかも悪くなりえないように見えていた。だが思いもしないことが起きたのだ。だからローザは何を代償にしてでも過去に戻りたいし、ただカシディをもう少しでも長く抱きしめたいのだった。日没後に笑い合い優しく身体を寄せ合った記憶がローザの心を満たしていた。
##red|This was different, a sickening worry. Not like when Kassidy had been gone for a few days. No, this was a frozen hole. She likened it to the Greek myth of soulmates, how humans were destined to search for their other half in vain. Rosa had found her other half, hadn't she?##
これは違った。吐きたくなるほどの不安。数日間カシディが去ったあの時とはまるで違う。いや、これは凍れる穴だ。彼女はそれをギリシャ神話に謳われる魂の伴侶--@@　　@@--人々がその片割れを探しても無駄に終わるという定め--@@　　@@--に喩えた。ローザは片割れを見つけたはずだったのだ。
##red|Where did they go? ##
あの人はどこにいったのだろう？
##red|She sighed, calm slowly drifting over her body. Rosa slowly let go of the pillow, tears still streaming down her face. She flopped onto her back, taking in a heavy breath. She closed her eyes for a second. When they opened, they rested on a framed picture of their wedding day. They traced Kassidy’s face. ##
ため息をつくと、ゆっくりと顔から身体にかけて落ち着きが広がっていった。涙は未だ顔を流れ落ちているがローザはゆっくりと枕を手放した。ローザは背中から倒れ込み、深呼吸した。1秒間眼を閉じた。眼を開いた時、額縁に入った結婚した日の写真が眼に止まった。カシディの顔をじっくりと眺めた。
##red|A silence drifted through the room. Rosa wiped her cheeks and stopped crying. She was so calm. Her body felt limp, and her head felt empty. Her eyes kept tracing Kassidy’s face as she stared at the photo. She held her breath; the lack of oxygen stung her lungs. The breath broke the stale air, and her lips curled into a wide smile.##
部屋は静寂に包まれた。ローザは頬を拭い泣き止んだ。彼女はとても落ち着いていた。身体に力は入らず、頭脳は空虚に感じられた。写真を見る彼女の眼はカシディの顔を見つめ続けていた。彼女は呼気を堪えた。酸欠が胸を刺した。呼気は固まった空気を乱し、彼女の唇は大きな笑みを形作った。
##red|Giggles pierced the silence. Rosa stood up and grabbed the photo, smashing it against the wall with a crunch of glass. Tears once again spilled out of her eyes.##
漏れ出た笑い声が静寂を裂いた。ローザは立ち上がって写真を掴んだ。壁に叩きつけてガラスの破片を撒いた。涙がが再び眼から零れた。
##red|“Fuck you! Fuck you!” she screamed, continuing to slam the frame into the wall. ##
「ファッキュー！ ファッキュー！」彼女は壁にフレームを何度も叩きつけながら叫んだ。
##red|“This was **my** happy ending! This was mine!” She let out an anguished howl as she tossed the dark wooden picture frame to the ground. ##
##red|Her throat stung as she kept screaming into the apartment. The shattered glass stuck to her feet as she walked over it. She caught her reflection in the standing mirror. Her skin pale, eyes dull with no light.##
##red|Rosa’s face twisted into an angry grimace as she pulled back her arm, launching it into the pristine surface. The shards of the broken mirror impaled themselves into her hand. Her eyes contrasted with her face, soft and sad against malice and contempt. ##
##red|She screamed incoherent words, as she ripped open the door to the bathroom. She tore into the drawers and cabinets. She wiped the counter clean of any objects. The crashing and shattering sounds only served to fuel the rage Rosa felt. ##
##red|“Fuck you! Fuck all of you! All you ever do is take from me! **All** you do is lure me in with false happiness!” ##
##red|Rosa walked over the mess of things on the floor. She didn’t have regard for her own existence. If the world was going to screw her around like this, why bother with life in the first place? ##
##red|She ran her head into a wall, producing a loud crack  sound and blurring her vision for a second. She didn’t know if the sound came from her skull or the wall, but she didn’t care. Her breath ran over her vocal cords as she grunted. ##
##red|Rosa blinked, looking for anything else to destroy. She felt so guilty, angry, and tired. Nothing mattered anymore. Her love was gone, and nothing could fix that. She looked at the stuff on the dresser. None of it mattered. Rage bubbled up inside of her again. ##
##red|It was so perfect. It didn’t deserve to look like that. It couldn’t be happy if she wasn’t happy. She slammed her body into it. Tearing into the drawers as she threw shirts and pants across the room. When nothing was in them, she broke the wooden drawers and tossed the parts over her shoulder. ##
##red|She couldn’t keep up like this. Her body was giving out. It all hurt so badly, and she couldn’t stand to feel this emptiness. The world was empty and she didn’t matter to anyone.##
##red|The phone buzzed on the bed, and Rosa went to grab it. The message only read “no dice” and she knew it was true. There wasn’t a body, no documents in SCiPnet, and almost nothing left of Kassidy. They weren't just missing, they were gone. Their presence had left the universe and wouldn’t return.  ##
##red|She slid against the bed, glass shards making way for her body as she sobbed. All of the anger and rage had subsided only to be replaced with grief. Her head pounded in time with her heart, and her throat felt shot. She leaned her head against the bed frame, tears sliding down her face, hands aimlessly wandering the carpet.##
##red|Her fingertips brushed the corner of the picture frame. She picked it up, looking at the damage she had done to it. Larger glass shards hung off of the dark ebony wood. Rosa sighed and put her focus on the picture. ##
##red|That was the happiest day of their lives. Meant to be the happily ever after she deserved. The one final chapter on her life, to live out the rest of her days in bliss. Yet, it was all ripped away in a second. Rosa knew no one was to blame for Kassidy’s disappearance, not a kidnapper or a murderer anyway.##
##red|“I’m so sorry.” ##
##red|Rosa’s tears dripped onto the exposed picture as she held it close to her, hugging it like it was the only thing that was left in the world.##

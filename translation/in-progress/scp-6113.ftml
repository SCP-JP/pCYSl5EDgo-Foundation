**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]Containment of SCP-6113-1 and SCP-6113-2 is not possible at the present moment. Containment efforts of SCP-6113 are primarily focused on the suppression of information surrounding it. The following special containment procedures for SCP-6113 have been implemented:[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** SCP-6113-1とSCP-6113-2の収容は現時点では不可能です。SCP-6113収容の努力は主にそれにまつわる情報を抑制することに焦点が当てられています。以下のSCP-6113用特別収容プロトコルが実施されています。
* [[span class="o"]]Spread disinformation surrounding SCP-6113-1 and SCP-6113-2 by Foundation web-crawlers and planted agents in an attempt to discredit any reported sightings and "Transition Events[[footnote]]See File 6113-2[[/footnote]]."[[/span]] _
あらゆる報告された目撃事例と「トランジションイベント[[footnote]]ファイル6113-2を参照のこと[[/footnote]]」の信用を損なうために、財団製ウェブクローラーと潜入エージェントによりSCP-6113-1とSCP-6113-2にまつわる偽情報を拡散します。
* [[span class="o"]]Locate and detain transgender individuals affected by SCP-6113 (henceforth referred to as "subject(s)") and hold them for questioning for no more than one week.[[/span]] _
SCP-6113の影響を受けたトランスジェンダーの人(以後「対象」と呼称します)の位置を特定し拘禁します。尋問のために1週間以上囚えてはなりません。
* [[span class="o"]]Update and modify any and all legal records of subjects to reflect their current sex and gender identity.[[/span]] _
対象のあらゆるかつ全ての法的記録を現在の性別とジェンダーアイデンティティを反映するように更新し改変します。
* [[span class="o"]]Apply Class A and E amnestics to subjects and any family, friends, and acquaintances, as well as implanting false memories as if the subject was assigned their gender at birth.[[/span]] _
クラスAおよびE記憶処理を対象とあらゆる家族、友人、そして知人に適用すると共に対象が出生時からそのジェンダーに分類されていたという偽記憶を埋め込みます。
* [[span class="o"]]Released subjects are monitored for one month to ensure complacency.[[/span]] _
対象を解放し、現状に満足しているかを確認するために1ヶ月間監視します。
[[span class="o"]]These procedures have been effective at maintaining global normality. However, SCP-6113 continues to affect subjects at an average rate of 4 subjects per 7 days. The number of subjects affected by SCP-6113 total over 243, as of 05/11/2019. The Department of Thaumaturgy is currently developing a permanent containment method for SCP-6113-1.[[/span]]
これらプロトコルは世界の正常性を維持するのに役立ってきました。しかしながら、平均して7日に4対象のレートでSCP-6113は対象に影響を及ぼし続けています。2019/11/05時点でSCP-6113の被影響対象数は合計243を超えています。奇跡術部門は現在SCP-6113-1の恒久的収容手段を開発しています。

[[span class="o"]]Despite numerous potential subjects employed at the Foundation, SCP-6113-1 refuses to enter Foundation property and conduct transition events on personnel. Testing on D-Class personnel; locating, tracking, and studying SCP-6113-1; and locating SCP-6113-2 is not possible at the present moment.[[/span]]
数多くの潜在的対象が財団に雇用されているにも関わらず、SCP-6113-1は財団の敷地に入ることとトランジションイベントを職員に起こすことを拒否しています。Dクラス職員での実験--@@　　@@--SCP-6113-1の位置特定、追跡、研究およびSCP-6113-2のいち特定は現在に至るまで不可能です。

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113 is the designation for multiple objects of varying class, labeled SCP-6113-1 through SCP-6113-3. Refer to the individual files below.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-6113とは様々なクラスの複数のオブジェクトに対する指定です。SCP-6113-1からSCP-6113-3まで分類されています。個々については以下のファイルを参照してください。

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]As of writing, SCP-6113-1 has not been contained. In the event of its sighting, Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") is to respond and follow standard humanoid apparition and reality bender containment protocols in an attempt to contain it. The Department of Thaumaturgy has yet to develop a conclusive containment method for SCP-6113-1.[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** 記載時点において、SCP-6113-1は収容されていません。目撃されているイベント中、機動部隊ラムダ-69 ("六色活動家")[[footnote]]**訳注:** 英語文化圏においてトランスジェンダーなどのシンボルカラーでもある虹は6色。[[/footnote]]はそれを収容するために反応し、標準人型霊的実体兼現実改変者収容プロトコルに従わねばなりません。奇跡術部門は未だ決定的なSCP-6113-1の収容方法を開発できていません。

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 is a humanoid entity capable of teleportation and disguising as and impersonating human beings. SCP-6113-1 uses its abilities to facilitate "Transition Events" in transgender individuals globally[[footnote]]See File 6113-2.[[/footnote]]. Current prevailing theories suggest SCP-6113-1 is a humanoid spirit or reality bender, but its true nature is unknown.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-6113-1はテレポーテーションと返送して人間になりすますことが可能な人型実体です。SCP-6113-1はその能力を用いて世界中のトランスジェンダーな個人に対する「トランジションイベント」を円滑に進めます[[footnote]]ファイル6113-2を読んでください[[/footnote]]。現在有力な仮説としてはSCP-6113-1は人間の霊魂または現実改変者であるといものですが、その本当の性質は不明です。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 typically reveals itself to subjects at their "lowest moment in life[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113.3: Subject Testimony.[[/footnote]]." When doing so, it disguises itself as a person the subject shares a positive emotional bond with, such as a family member, friend, significant other, or teacher (henceforth referred to as "companion"). Using information about the subject's personal life and relationship to the companion, it guides the subject to SCP-6113-2 with its teleportation abilities. Subjects do not notice the moment of teleportation, as if they had continuously walked to the destination. How SCP-6113-1 obtains knowledge of the subject's life, the personality of the companion, and their relationship to the companion is unknown (but theorized to be a form of mind reading).[[/span]]
SCP-6113-1が対象の前に現れるのは典型的には対象が「人生最低の瞬間[[footnote]]補遺6113.3: 対象の証言 を読んでください[[/footnote]]」である時です。この時、それは対象がポジティブな感情的繋がりをともにする人物--@@　　@@--たとえば家族、友人、重要な他者、あるいは教師(以後「仲間」と呼称します)--@@　　@@--に扮します。対象のパーソナルライフの情報と仲間との関係性を利用し、テレポーテーション能力を用いて対象をSCP-6113-2に導きます。対象はあたかも持続的に目的地に向けて歩いているかのようにテレポーテーションの瞬間に気付きません。対象の人生、仲間の性格、および仲間との関係性についての知識をどのようにしてSCP-6113-1が得ているのかは不明です(が読心の一種であると仮説が立てられています)。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 has also been observed to:[[/span]]
SCP-6113-1はこれまで以下のように観察されてきました。
* [[span class="o"]]Protect subjects from all physical harm, self-induced or otherwise, for a short time before and after appearing to them;[[/span]] _
対象を全ての物理的危害、自傷他傷問わず、から出現前後の短い期間守ります。
* [[span class="o"]]Possess intimate knowledge about the subject's personal life, mental health, and relationships;[[/span]] _
対象のパーソナルライフ、メンタルヘルス、および関係性について極めて詳細な知識を所有しています。
* [[span class="o"]]Exude a feeling of calmness and comfort.[[/span]] _
穏やかで心地よい感情を滲ませています。
[[span class="o"]]Additionally, it is also theorized that SCP-6113-1 can become invisible so as to reveal itself to the subject at the right moment. SCP-6113-1 has not demonstrated any new abilities since its discovery on 20/04/2019, but it may or may not possess any more.[[/span]]
加えて、まさにその瞬間に対象の前に出現できるように、SCP-6113-1は不可視となれます。SCP-6113-1は2019/04/20に発見されてから新しい能力を何も発揮していませんが、それ以上のものを持っているかどうかは不明です。

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]As of writing, SCP-6113-2 has not been contained. Due to its passive nature and contradictory descriptions, containment efforts are low priority compared to containing SCP-6113-1. If an opportunity to locate and contain SCP-6113-2 presents itself, Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") and the Department of Anomalous Locations are to respond and contain SCP-6113-2.[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** 記載時点において、SCP-6113-2は収容されていません。その受動的性質と相反する説明により、収容の努力はSCP-6113-1の収容と比較して低優先度となっています。SCP-6113-2の位置特定と収容の機会が現れた場合、機動部隊ラムダ-69 ("六色活動家")と異常地点部門が反応してSCP-6113-2を収容しなければなりません。

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-2 is a natural freshwater lake somewhere on Earth at an unknown location. Descriptions of SCP-6113-2 are inconsistent and contradictory, however, most subjects recall a lake consistent with that of forested areas in the Midwest region of the United States.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-6113-2は地球上のどこか不明な場所にある自然豊かな淡水湖です。SCP-6113-2の説明は一貫せず相反していますが、しかし、ほとんどの対象は合衆国中西部の森林地帯にある湖のそれであると記憶しています。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-2 is the destination for SCP-6113-1 and its subjects when conducting "Transition Events." A transition event can only occur when SCP-6113-1, no more than one subject, and SCP-6113-2 are within each other's presence. The steps of a transition event are as follows[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113.3: Subject Testimony.[[/footnote]]:[[/span]]
SCP-6113-2はSCP-6113-1とその対象が「トランジションイベント」を行う際の目的地です。SCP-6113-1、1人きりの対象、そしてSCP-6113-2が共にある場合にのみトランジションイベントは発生します。トランジションイベントのステップは以下の通りです[[footnote]]補遺6113.3: 対象の証言 を読んでください[[/footnote]]。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 reveals itself to the subject, disguised as the subject's companion, protecting them from physical harm if necessary. In most cases, this happens alone. It is unclear whether it teleports directly or becomes visible.[[/span]] _
必要があれば物理的危害から守りつつ、対象の仲間に扮したSCP-6113-1が対象の前に現れます。ほとんどの事例においてこれは独りでに発生します。それが直接テレポートしてくるのか、あるいは可視化するのかは不明です。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 calms and comforts the subject. Subjects do not question why their companion is suddenly accompanying them, as if this is completely normal.[[/span]] _
SCP-6113-1は対象を落ち着かせ安んじます。何故仲間が突然そばにいてくれるのかについて、あたかも完全にそれが普通のことであるかのように対象は質問しません。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 suggests they go for a walk, guiding them to the lake. To the subject, the apparent environment morphs to match a theoretical path to SCP-6113-2 as if it were within walking distance. Only the subject perceives this. The actual physical locations remain unchanged. These hallucinations could also be the cause of the varying descriptions of SCP-6113-2. Again, subjects do not question this.[[/span]] _
SCP-6113-1は散歩を提案し、湖に対象を導きます。対象に対して周りの環境が、歩いて行ける範囲内にあるかのようにSCP-6113-2への理論上の経路に合致するように変形します。対象のみがこれを知覚します。実際の物理的位置は不変です。これら幻覚はまたSCP-6113-2の説明が様々なものとなる理由でもあります。また、これについて対象は質問しません。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1, engaged in conversation with the subject about their personal life, offers the subject a seat at the edge of the lake, sitting with them. Topics have included school grades, relationships, and future plans.[[/span]] _
パーソナルライフについて対象と会話しているSCP-6113-1は湖の畔に共に座ることを提案します。会話内容は学校生活、関係性、そして将来設計についてです。
# [[span class="o"]]At some point, the conversation topic naturally shifts to that of gender identity and gender dysphoria[[footnote]]A term for psychological distress caused by an incongruence between one's sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.[[/footnote]] (or euphoria).[[/span]] _
ある時、ジェンダーアイデンティティとジェンダーディスフォリア[[footnote]]出生時の性別とジェンダーアイデンティティの不一致により引き起こされる精神的苦痛を指す用語[[/footnote]](あるいはユーフォーリア)についての会話に自然に移行します。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 then prompts the subject to view their reflection in the lake. When subjects view their reflection in the water, they first see themselves as is. Slowly, the reflection—and physical body—of the subject will permanently shift until matching their ideal gender identity. The sex characteristics and chromosomes of the subject are primarily affected. This process is similar to that of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-113 SCP-113], but notably painless.[[/span]] _
SCP-6113-1はこの時対象に湖面に映る自身の反射を見るように促します。水に映る反射を対象が見た時、最初は自身を見ることになります。ゆっくりと対象の反射像および物理的身体がジェンダーアイデンティティに合致するまで恒久的に移行します。性的特徴と染色体が主に影響を受けます。このプロセスは[[[scp-113|SCP-113]]]のそれに類似していますが、無痛である点が特徴的です。
# [[span class="o"]]The subject expresses a strong emotional reaction (most often excitement and joy, but sometimes anxiety and fear) in which SCP-6113-1 responds appropriately.[[/span]] _
対象は強い感情的反応(ほとんどの場合しばしば興奮と歓喜、ときどき不安と恐怖)を表現します。それにSCP-6113-1は適切に応じます。
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 then guides the subject back to their original location, saying goodbye before leaving either via teleportation or invisibility.[[/span]] _
そしてSCP-6113-1は元いた位置に戻るよう対象を導いて、テレポーテーションか不可視化して去る前に別れを告げます。
[[span class="o"]]Subjects that have underwent a transition event, though occasionally possessing atypical anatomy for humans of a binary sex, are non-anomalous. "Transition Events" do not significantly alter a subject's height, weight, and features that are not related to transitioning. Subjects also report feeling more confident and determined to improve their quality of life.[[/span]]
トランジションイベントを経験した対象は--@@　　@@--ときどき人類の2種類の性別からかけ離れた解剖を持ちますが--@@　　@@--非異常です。「トランジションイベント」は対象の身長、体重、そしてトランジションに関係ない機能を大幅には変更しません。対象はまた、より自信がつき、QOLを向上させる決意をしたと報告します。

[[span class="o"]]**Addendum 6113.1:** Discovery[[/span]]
**補遺6113.1:** 発見

[[span class="o"]]On 17/04/2019, reports of subjects suddenly and perfectly changing sex characteristics without the need for medical procedures and Hormone Replacement Therapy began circulating on local news and social media. Only three days later did these reports capture the attention of the Foundation. Before discovery, 126 subjects had been affected by SCP-6113.[[/span]]
2019/04/17、医学的処置とホルモン置換療法を用いずに唐突かつ完全に性的特徴が変化した対象に関する報告が地元ニュースとソーシャルメディアに出回り始めました。3日後にこれら報告が財団の注意を惹きました。発見以前に126人の対象がSCP-6113の影響を受けていました。

[[span class="o"]]**Addendum 6113.2:** Initial Containment Efforts[[/span]]
**補遺6113.2:** 初期収容努力

[[span class="o"]]On 20/04/2019, several Mobile Task Forces were deployed as the Department of Public Disinformation worked to discredit any reports of SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-2, and its effects on subjects. During the initial containment efforts, subjects were detained and brought to nearby low-security Foundation facilities. Subjects were held for no more than one week. During this time, they were questioned about SCP-6113-1 and SCP-6113-2 while records and legal documents—such as birth certificates, passports, and driver's licenses—were updated to reflect their current gender.[[/span]]
2019/04/20、SCP-6113-1、SCP-6113-2、およびその対象たちに及ぼした効果についてのあらゆる報告の信用を公衆虚偽情報部門が毀損するためにいくつかの機動部隊が派遣されました。初期収容努力中、対象たちは捕えられ、近隣の低セキュリティ財団施設に移送されました。対象が捕えられた期間は1週間を超えませんでした。この期間中、対象たちはSCP-6113-1とSCP-6113-2について質問されていました。対象たちの記録および法的文書--@@　　@@--たとえば出生証明、パスポート、および運転免許証--@@　　@@--が現状のジェンダーを反映するように更新されました。

[[span class="o"]]Before being released, subjects were given Class A and F amnestics. Any family, friends, and acquaintances of the subject were given Class E amnestics. Both subjects and associates were given false memories as if the subject was assigned their current gender at birth.[[/span]]
解放される前に対象にはクラスAおよびF記憶処理薬が投与されました。対象のあらゆる家族、友人、および知人にクラスE記憶処理薬が投与されました。対象の出生時の性別が現在のジェンダーであるという偽記憶が対象と関係者の双方に与えられました。

[[span class="o"]]**Addendum 6113.3:** Subject Testimony[[/span]]
**補遺6113.3:** 対象の証言

[[span class="o"]]Over 243 subject testimonies have been collected since discovery. These testimonies are the basis for our understanding of SCP-6113. Notable testimonies are summarized below:[[/span]]

シン・ユーン＝ジ ||= 20 || [[span class="o"]]Subject, while in university in the United States, came out to her parents, who live in Incheon, South Korea, over phone call. Subject's parents were unaccepting and transphobic, threatening to disown her if she transitions. Subject was distraught for several hours. SCP-6113-1, disguised as her boyfriend, appeared to the subject. Notably, subject's boyfriend was out of state at the time.[[/span]] _
合衆国の大学に在学中の対象は南朝鮮の仁川在住の両親と電話をしました。対象の両親は受け入れることができず、トランスフォビア[[footnote]]**訳注:** トランスジェンダーに激しい恐怖と嫌悪を感じること[[/footnote]]であり、トランジションをした場合勘当すると脅迫しました。彼氏に扮したSCP-6113-1が対象の前に現われました。特筆すべきことに、対象の彼氏は当時州の外にいました。||

ノア・オキタ ||= 46 || [[span class="o"]]Subject was laid off from his job recently and was not able to afford rent. Subject, his husband, and his two children struggled financially. Faced with eviction, SCP-6113-1 appeared to the subject, disguised as his father.[[/span]] _
対象は仕事から解雇されたばかりであり、家賃を支払う余裕がありませんでした。対象、たその夫、および2人の子どもは経済的に苦難に喘いでいました。立ち退きに直面した際に、父親に扮したSCP-6113-1が対象の前に現われました。 ||

SCP-6113-1, disguised as her wife at a younger age, appeared to the subject when she found a photograph of the couple. Subject was also made apparently younger during her transition event. This effect did not last after the event.[[/span]] _
先立って対象の妻が亡くなり、数ヶ月間抑うつ状態となっていました。対象が2人の写真を見つけた時、若かりし頃の妻に扮したSCP-6113-1が対象の前に現われました。トランジションイベントの間、対象は明らかに若くなっていました。この効果はイベント後には続きませんでした。 ||

The razor blade could not break her skin. Frustrated, subject threw the razor blade across the room and collapsed crying. SCP-6113-1, disguised as her older sister, appeared in the bathroom to comfort her. Notably, the bathroom has no windows and only one door.[[/span]] _
継続的トランスフォビア・ハラスメントを受け、極度の感情的苦痛の中に対象はありました。対象は浴室にて両手首のリストカットによる自殺を試みました。カミソリの刃は肌を傷付けられませんでした。苛立った対象はカミソリ刃を部屋の向こうに投げ捨て泣き崩れました。姉に扮したSCP-6113-1が浴室内に現われて慰めました。特筆すべきことに、浴室には窓はなく、扉が1つきりしかありませんでした。 ||

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 (known as █████ ███████, formerly █████ ███████[[footnote]]Personally identifiable information redacted to protect identity.[[/footnote]]), is a non-anomalous[[footnote]]Objects classed as "Eparch" are done so for its anomalous circumstances or relationship to the anomalous rather than for having anomalous properties.[[/footnote]] female human of Filipino descent. Records indicate SCP-6113-3 was born on ██/██/2007, making her 12 years old. She is 152 cm tall and weighs 50 kg, and is generally healthy.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-6113-3(█████ ███████として知られ、以前は█████ ███████でした)[[footnote]]個人を特定可能な情報は個人情報保護のため削除済み[[/footnote]]は非異常[[footnote]]"Eparch"としてオブジェクトクラスが与えられるのは異常な性質を持つというよりむしろ異常な状況あるいは異常性との関係性による[[/footnote]]なフィリピン系女性です。記録によるとSCP-6113-3は2007/██/██に生まれ、12歳であるとされます。身長152cm、体重50kgであり、通常健康です。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 was one of several subjects of SCP-6113. Assigned male at birth, SCP-6113-3 considers herself a transgender female and uses the pronouns "she/her."[[/span]]
SCP-6113-3はSCP-6113の対象の中の1人でした。出生時に男性に分類されていましたが、SCP-6113-3は自身をトランスジェンダーの女性であると考え、代名詞として「彼女」を使用しています。

[[span class="o"]]Despite SCP-6113-3 being completely non-anomalous, her containment is necessary out of altruism by order of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4175 Ethics Subcommittee for Humanoid Entities] due to the nature of her discovery.[[/span]]
SCP-6113-3は完全に非異常ですが、その収容は発見時の性質のため、[[[scp-4175|人型実体に対する小倫理委員会]]]の命令において利他主義の範囲を逸脱して必要とされています。

[[span class="o"]]**Addendum 6113-3.1:** Discovery, Personal Background, and Reason for Containment[[/span]]
**補遺6113-3.1:** 発見、個人的背景、および収容理由

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 was discovered on 20/04/2019 in the San Diego, California Stillwater Hospital system when baffled doctors and nurses attempted to treat the effects of her transition event. A child abuse report to Child Protective Services had also been filed by the Jefferson family and the hospital. Before SCP-6113-3's containment, the Jefferson family and hospital staff were questioned to confirm her condition. However, the Jeffersons were mistakingly amnesticized due to a miscommunication before SCP-6113-3 could be returned. Hospital records, legal records, and the CPS report were expunged from all databases.[[/span]]
SCP-6113-3は2019/04/20にサン・ディエゴのカリフォルニア・スチルウォーター病院システム内にて困惑した医師と看護師がトランジションイベントの効果に対して治療を試みていた際に発見されました。ジェファーソン家と病院による児童保護サービスへの児童虐待の報告がまた提出されていました。SCP-6113-3を収容する以前に、彼女の状態について確認するための質問をジェファーソン家と病院スタッフにしました。しかし、連絡ミスによりSCP-6113-3が戻る前にジェファーソン家は間違えて記憶処理されました。診療録、法的記録、およびCPSレポートは全てのデータベースから削除されました。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 faced emotional and verbal abuse by her biological parents Jorge and Victoria ███████. She lacked friends and would often face bullying at school. SCP-6113-3 would frequently visit her friend Alena Jefferson, as well as her parents Dameon and Rie Jefferson. SCP-6113-3 would accompany the Jeffersons to their family lake house at what is believed to be SCP-6113-2. After being expelled from her home, SCP-6113-3 came to the Jeffersons, with whom she was discovered. Jorge and Victoria ███████ were not amnesticized, however.[[/span]]
生物学的両親であるジョージおよびヴィクトリア・███████から感情的かつ言語的虐待をSCP-6113-3は受けていました。友人はなく、学校においてもいじめられていました。SCP-6113-3は頻繁に友人であるアレナ・ジェファーソンとその両親であるダミオンおよびリー・ジェファーソンの下を訪ねていました。SCP-6113-3はSCP-6113-2であると信じられている湖の畔の別荘にジェファーソン一家に伴われて行きました。実家から追放された跡、SCP-6113-3は発見時に共に居たジェファーソン家に身を寄せました。しかし、ジョージおよびヴィクトリア・███████は記憶処理されませんでした。

[[span class="o"]]Three days into SCP-6113-3's week-long holding period, during which she was uncooperative, the following memo was sent to Site Director Thomas Graham.[[/span]]
SCP-6113-3が非協力的なまま過ごした1週間の勾留期間の3日目に、以下の覚書がサイト管理官トーマス・グラハムに送信されました。

**To:** サイト-17管理官 トーマス・グラハム
[[span class="o"]]**From:** Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian[[/span]]
**From:** 倫理委員会連絡員 ジェレミア・シメリアン
[[span class="o"]]**Subject:** SCP-6113 Subject #126[[/span]]
**Subject:** SCP-6113対象#126

[[span class="o"]]Graham,[[/span]]
グラハム

[[span class="o"]]We have been watching the SCP-6113 situation closely. With hundreds of civilian subjects passing through our facilities, it is our duty to confirm they are being treated ethically. One of these subjects at your facility has captured our attention: SCP-6113 Subject #126. I am sure you have read her file.[[/span]]
私たちはSCP-6113の状況について仔細に観察し続けていますからね。私たちの施設を何百という市民が通過して行きますが、彼らが倫理的に扱われていることを確認することが私たちの義務なのです。あなたの施設にいるそれら対象の中の1人が私たちの注意を惹きました。SCP-6113対象#126です。あなたのことですから彼女のファイルについて読んだことがきっとあるでしょう。

[[span class="o"]]Nevertheless, according to the report, she was recently expelled from her home and faced homelessness. In the chaos, it seems the Jefferson family has already been amnesticized by mistake, despite their kindness. Returning Subject #126 would be difficult as the reason for her expulsion has already been cleared from the Jeffersons' memories, and returning her to her biological parents is a non-starter. Under any other circumstances, we would not have interfered, however, this was a massive oversight on the field agents' part.[[/span]]
それにしても、報告書によりますと、彼女は最近実家から放逐されてホームレスになりましたね。混乱していたからか、ジェファーソン家が既に誤って記憶処理されてしまったようですね。彼らは親切でしたのにね。ジェファーソン家の記憶から対象#126の放逐が既に消し去られていることと、彼女の生物学的両親の下に帰すのが役立たないことを鑑みると彼女を帰還させるのは難しいでしょう。他のどのような境遇であろうと私たちは干渉してきませんでしたが、しかし、これはフィールドエージェントたちの盛大なミスですからね。

[[span class="o"]]As a consequence of their malfeasance, we have deemed it unethical to release Subject #126 into civilian life. We cannot accept her ending up homeless, in foster care, or dead. Therefore, she has been designated SCP-6113-3 and will be held at Site-17 until the age of 18. She is under your care now, draft Containment Procedures appropriately.[[/span]]
彼らの不正行為の結果として、私たちは対象#126を市民生活に放つことを非倫理的であると見做します。私たちは彼女がホームレス、里子、あるいは死ぬという帰結を許しません。よって、彼女はSCP-6113-3に指定され、サイト-17に18歳になるまで勾留されるでしょう。彼女はあなたの保護下に今やいますので収容プロトコルを起草してください、適切にね。

[[span class="o"]]We will be checking on her regularly. Any faults found in her care can and will fall on you.[[/span]]
定期的に彼女をチェックしますからね。彼女の世話においてなにかしらの失敗が見つかった場合、その責任が降りかかるのはあなたですよ。

**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses> You were right. We do have a lot in common. And, to be honest, you're the only person here who's shown me any... humanity.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Are the other staff not kind to you?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** They're //kind,// but not //human.// Like you said, I'm just another number to them. Hell, you're the only one here who bothers to use my name.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Right... where is this going?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <inhales deeply> My name is █████ ███████. I'm 12 years old and I'm from SoCal. I was bullied pretty heavily in school because... well, you can guess. My only friend was Alena, and I hung out with her family a lot. They took me to their lake house in Minnesota every summer, and it was the only time I ever truly felt free. <pauses> My parents were so fucking shitty, it's unbelievable. <speaking quickens> They wanted me to be a boy, they wanted me to go to college and study XYZ major. I had to do this, I had to do that. Nothing could be said nicely, it was always shouting.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** <sitting in a chair> Well, why is that?[[/span]]

**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** About <airquotes mockingly> "how much we have in common." That includes trauma.[[/span]]

**SCP-6113-3:**

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <under breath> Nerd. Sorry, sorry. Go on.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** ...Most of my life was spent trying to appease my parents. I spent all my time studying or doing some extracurricular they demanded at the time. I never really had a social life cause I always had my face buried in a damn book. And yet, no matter what, it was never enough for them. My sisters were always somehow better than me. Pissed the hell out of me. <pauses> All the studying paid off, though, because I got the most prestigious job out of anyone in my family. Wanna know what the problem is?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** What?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:**

**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Okay, well. I knew //long// before any spirit or lake told me so. Sites like Tumblr kinda turn you queer. No, I'm kidding, I just learned the words from it. But, I mean... I don't know man. Even //before// that, girls to me just... felt better in every way. They were prettier, they were cuter, they got to like the color pink and all that shit, y'know? I remember being so depressed that I just can't be a girl. My aunties always said I'm such a lady's man, and it made me //so// uncomfortable. I didn't //want// to be a lady's man, I wanted to... be a girl that loves girls. But, //no,// "girls //can't// love girls" is what my mom said. <laughs softly> And, that fellas, is called gender fucking dysphoria! It's so much fun, you should try it some day. <pauses> But, I mean... yeah. That's just me, though. Not every trans person feels like that.[[/span]]

**パーク博士:**

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** So, you're ready, █████?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Eh, you could say that. I probably don't want you to get, like, fired or anything.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Then, you do understand I have to remain professional, right?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses> Yeah.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Alright. <sits down> This is Interview Log 22 with SCP-6113-3. <hesitates> Date is September 17th, 2019. Time is 1:04 PM. Now... you were one of SCP-6113-1's subjects, correct?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <shifts in her seat> Yes.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Can you tell me what happened when it appeared to you?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Well, um. After... //that// happened—[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Sorry to interrupt, please describe what "that" was for the record.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Right, uh, after my parents... kicked me out, //"it"// kinda just appeared to me. I don't know, I was kinda just... like... walking down my street. There was no one around, most people were sleeping.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** <writing> Mhm. Go on?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** So, there was no one on the street. It was like midnight or something. Obviously, I was in shock and crying and shit, but I looked up and like... she was there?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** "She?"[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Err, Alena. Well, not like, //Alena// Alena, obviously. But, it looked like her. I didn't see her dad or mom, not even their car. They don't live in the same neighborhood. I didn't... question it, though. Like, it was weird, obviously, but I didn't realize it at the time. And, suddenly, we were talking and walking. I stopped crying, we talked about... y'know... makeup and shit, whatever teenage girls talk about. Didn't even realize it, but there we were at their lake house.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Do you mind telling me what it looked like?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses for a few minutes> I don't... remember.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** That's okay. So, you're at the lake, and then what?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** We just... sat at the edge and talked. Felt like hours, I swear I watched the moon set. Just talked and talked and talked.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** About what?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Y'know. Her family, our vacations together, shit only her and I knew. Didn't even realize it wasn't her.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** It knew all of it without asking you.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Right. <pauses> Then, she brought it up.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Brought "what" up?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Y'know, transitioning, like that sorta thing.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** What kind of things?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Like, clothes I wanted to wear, HRT, name changes, surgery, all that jazz.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** And, how'd that make you feel?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Nervous? Uncomfortable? I kinda forgot that I was //just// kicked out. I even told her that.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Right... what happened after that?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** She took me in this big warm hug. It was like 30 degrees and she was //warm.// Told me everything was going to be alright and all. She said she loved me and she'd pick me up soon.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Huh.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** She told me to look in the lake. And, I mean, yeah. You probably know what happened from there.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Well, say it anyway. For the records.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Okay, well, I stood up and looked in the water. And, like, dude, it was //weird.// I //saw// myself turn into a girl. //Me.// A //girl.// Like, holy //shit.// I kinda just... got on my knees and started crying. Then, Alena grabbed me by the shoulders and picked me up and said we had to go. So, we walked away and suddenly I was back on my home street. Not even at the end of the block.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

= [[span class="o"]]//<There is silence for a few moments.>//[[/span]]
= //<>//

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** She said she had to go, but that she'd be back. So, we hugged and said "bye," and then she was just gone.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** You weren't confused or anything?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Of course, I was. All of this was confusing. I was angry, depressed, I suddenly had a girl's body. <pauses> I was //euphoric//, though. I called Alena and told her everything. Her and her parents came to pick me up. And, well, then we went to the hospital. You know what happened then.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** How did they react?[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Wouldn't you know?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** Please, SC— Please, just tell me if you're comfortable.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** <sigh> Okay. They were furious at my parents mostly. Then, they noticed I looked different. Smaller shoulders, big hips, my clothes not really fitting me anymore. Chalked it up to puberty. Alena didn't even remember what just happened. Thought I was so depressed I was hallucinating or something, I don't know. When she gave me a hug, though, she just... didn't feel as warm. The real kicker, though, is when I had to go to the bathroom. //That's// when they took me to the hospital.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Dr. Park,[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]We have been made aware of your expungement of data from SCP-6113-3's 22nd interview. As the interview's transcript and audio and visual content is unlikely to contain any sort of memetic-, cognito-, or infohazard, expungement is highly unnecessary. For now, we have not yet chosen to contact RAISA about restoring the expunged data. However, we can not let this go unreprimanded.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]As of 18/09/2019, you have been placed under probation. We will be conducting a full investigation of your actions with the Foundation. You will continue your duties as SCP-6113 Senior Researcher. Any faults found in your employment history, or further actions inconsistent with Foundation policy, will lead to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of contract.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Dr. Park,[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]The development of the SCP-6113 project has piqued the interest of this committee as of late. With SCP-6113-3's unique containment situation, one should take care when acquiring information from her as to not cross the boundary between object and researcher. While your methods have no doubt proved effective in the containment of SCP-6113, it is of this committee's opinion that you have acted unethically in growing too comfortable with SCP-6113-3. Your continued disregard for the ethical integrity of your position has forced us to take disciplinary action out of an abundance of caution.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Effective immediately, you are removed from the SCP-6113 project and demoted to Level 2 Assistant Researcher. You are to be transferred to Site-06-3 immediately. You are also barred from any and all contact with SCP-6113-3. If found in violation of this injunction, your contract with the Foundation is to be terminated and you will be amnesticized. SCP-6113 Assistant Researcher Dr. Brandon Fisher is promoted to the position of SCP-6113 Senior Researcher.[[/span]]

**補遺6113-3.18:** 

[[span class="o"]]On 06/11/2019, at 11:42 AM, two guards arrived at Dr. James Park's office to escort him off the premises. Dr. Park had, presumably, already read the injunction at this point. The office door, however, was locked and the blinds closed.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]As they attempted to negotiate with Dr. Park, they reportedly heard crying and sounds of emotional distress inside his office. Additional security personnel were summoned, and preparations were made in the event Dr. Park turned violent. Dr. Park was non-cooperative with orders to open the door. Threats of termination were met with silence. Security personnel were ordered to forcibly enter his office. Upon entrance, Dr. Park was not found inside his office. Notably, the only exit from his office is through the door that was breached. Dr. Park's personal effects were left intact, and his computer terminal was left logged in. There was no sign of a struggle. Seen below is the email his terminal was open to.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Site-17 was not put on lockdown, however, all security personnel were ordered to search for and detain Dr. Park immediately. After approximately four hours, at 4:45 PM, the order was lifted. Search efforts for Dr. Park was initiated for all Foundation agents and applicable Mobile Task Forces within a 100 km radius. As of writing, Dr. Park has not been found.[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]##blue|Containment of SCP-6113-1 is not possible at the present moment. Containment efforts of SCP-6113 are primarily focused on the suppression of information surrounding it. Along with SCP-6113-2's containment procedures, the following special containment procedures for SCP-6113 have been implemented:##[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** 
* [[span class="o"]]Spread disinformation surrounding SCP-6113-1 through multiple platforms by Foundation web-crawlers and planted agents in an attempt to discredit any reported sightings and "Transition Events[[footnote]]See File 6113-2[[/footnote]]."[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Locate and detain transgender individuals affected by SCP-6113 (henceforth referred to as "subject(s)") and hold them for questioning for no more than one week.[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Update and modify any and all legal records of subjects to reflect their current sex and gender identity.[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Apply Class A and E amnestics to subjects and any family, friends, and acquaintances, as well as implanting false memories as if the subject was assigned their gender at birth.[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Released subjects are monitored for one month to ensure complacency.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]These procedures have been effective at maintaining global normality. ##blue|However, SCP-6113-1 continues to affect subjects at an increasing average rate of 8 subjects per 7 days. The number of subjects affected by SCP-6113 total over 315, as of 10/01/2020.## The Department of Thaumaturgy is currently developing a permanent containment method for SCP-6113-1.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Despite numerous potential subjects employed at the Foundation, SCP-6113-1 refuses to enter Foundation property and conduct transition events on personnel. ##blue|Testing on D-Class personnel and locating, tracking, and studying SCP-6113-1 is not possible at the present moment.##[[/span]]

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113 is the designation for multiple objects of varying class, labeled SCP-6113-1 through SCP-6113-3. Refer to the individual files below.[[/span]]

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 is a humanoid entity capable of teleportation and disguising as and impersonating human beings. SCP-6113-1 uses its abilities to facilitate "Transition Events" in transgender individuals globally[[footnote]]See File 6113-2.[[/footnote]]. Current prevailing theories suggest SCP-6113-1 is a humanoid spirit or reality bender, but its true nature is unknown. ##blue|SCP-6113-1's physical form, however, is a humanoid being made of solid orange light. Its estimated height is 180 cm and it glows at approximately 12 lumens.[[/span]]
**説明:** 

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 typically reveals itself to subjects at their "lowest moment in life[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113.3: Subject Testimony.[[/footnote]]." When doing so, it disguises itself as a person the subject shares a positive emotional bond with, such as a family member, friend, significant other, or teacher (henceforth referred to as "companion"). Using information about the subject's personal life and relationship to the companion, it guides the subject to SCP-6113-2 with its teleportation abilities. Subjects do not notice the moment of teleportation, as if they had continuously walked to the destination. How SCP-6113-1 obtains knowledge of the subject's life, the personality of the companion, and their relationship to the companion is unknown (but theorized to be a form of mind reading).[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 has also been observed to:[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Protect subjects from all physical harm, self-induced or otherwise, for a short time before and after appearing to them;[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Possess intimate knowledge about the subject's personal life, mental health, and relationships;[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Exude a feeling of calmness and comfort.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]Additionally, it is also theorized that SCP-6113-1 can become invisible so as to reveal itself to the subject at the right moment. SCP-6113-1 has not demonstrated any new abilities since its discovery on 20/04/2019, but it may or may not possess any more.[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]##blue|Local properties have been cleared from the area and a perimeter of chain link fences 1 km from the edge of the lake has been established. No fewer than 2 guards every 4 km are to continuously patrol the perimeter to deter trespassers. Trespassers are to be detained and turned over to local law enforcement, given Class A amnestics if necessary. A cover story involving a drowning risk has been disseminated through local media.##[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** 

[[span class="o"]]Provisional Site-15 has been established within the perimeter at the lake's eastern edge, disguised as an abandoned boat rental building. CCTV cameras disguised as wildlife cameras have been attached to nearby trees, and their footage routed to and recorded at Provisional Site-15. 2 guards are to be stationed there at all times to monitor CCTV footage. If SCP-6113-1 or any subjects are seen at or near SCP-6113-2, Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") are to respond and contain SCP-6113-1 and detain any subjects.[[/span]]

**Description:** [[span class="o"]]##blue|SCP-6113-2 is Little Caribou Lake in Minnesota state##[[footnote]]48°04'05"N 90°15'39"W[[/footnote]]. SCP-6113-2 is the destination for SCP-6113-1 and its subjects when conducting "Transition Events." A transition event can only occur when SCP-6113-1, no more than one subject, and SCP-6113-2 are within each other's presence. The steps of a transition event are as follows[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113.3: Subject Testimony.[[/footnote]]:[[/span]]
**説明:** 
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 reveals itself to the subject, disguised as the subject's companion, protecting them from physical harm if necessary. In most cases, this happens alone. It is unclear whether it teleports directly or becomes visible.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 calms and comforts the subject. Subjects do not question why their companion is suddenly accompanying them, as if this is completely normal.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 suggests they go for a walk, guiding them to the lake. To the subject, the apparent environment morphs to match a theoretical path to SCP-6113-2 as if it were within walking distance. Only the subject perceives this. The actual physical locations remain unchanged. These hallucinations could also be the cause of the varying descriptions of SCP-6113-2. Again, subjects do not question this.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1, engaged in conversation with the subject about their personal life, offers the subject a seat at the edge of the lake, sitting with them. Topics have included school grades, relationships, and future plans.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]At some point, the conversation topic naturally shifts to that of gender identity and gender dysphoria[[footnote]]A term for psychological distress caused by an incongruence between one's sex assigned at birth and their gender identity.[[/footnote]] (or euphoria).[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 then prompts the subject to view their reflection in the lake. When subjects view their reflection in the water, they first see themselves as is. Slowly, the reflection—and physical body—of the subject will permanently shift until matching their ideal gender identity. The sex characteristics and chromosomes of the subject are primarily affected. This process is similar to that of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-113 SCP-113], but notably painless.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]The subject expresses a strong emotional reaction (most often excitement and joy, but sometimes anxiety and fear) in which SCP-6113-1 responds appropriately.[[/span]]
# [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-1 then guides the subject back to their original location, saying goodbye before leaving either via teleportation or invisibility.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]Subjects that have underwent a transition event, though occasionally possessing atypical anatomy for humans of a binary sex, are non-anomalous. "Transition Events" do not significantly alter a subject's height, weight, and features that are not related to transitioning. Subjects also report feeling more confident and determined to improve their quality of life.[[/span]]

[[span class="o" style="color:blue;"]]Despite no subjects arriving at SCP-6113-2 and its containment area, subjects continue to undergo transition events globally. Research into if SCP-6113-2's anomalous properties even exist is underway[[footnote]]Objects classed as "Drygioni" are under investigation for authenticity by the O5 Council.[[/footnote]].[[/span]]

**Special Containment Procedures:** [[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 has escaped containment, assisted by SCP-6113-1 and presumably Dr. James Park[[/span]][[footnote]]See Addendum 6113-3.20: Containment Breach 6113-3 15/11/2019.[[/footnote]][[span class="o"]]. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") is to locate SCP-6113-3 and bring her into containment where she will be held until the age of 18 in 2025. If such a time passes without recontainment, she is instead to be located and given Class C and G amnestics. Dr. James Park is to be terminated as soon as possible.[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** 

[[span class="o"]]Amnesticization and planting of false memories in SCP-6113-3 to remove any knowledge of Dr. James Park pending Ethics Committee approval.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]As of writing, SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park have not been located.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Date:** 15/11/2019[[/span]]
**日時:** 2019/11/15
[[span class="o"]]**Site:** 17[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**SCP(s) Involved:** SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**MTF(s) Involved:** Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders")[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**Personnel Involved:** Various Site-17 security personnel, Dr. Brandon Fisher[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**Other(s) Involved:** Dr. James Park (presumably)[[/span]]
----
[[span class="o"]]On 15/11/2019, at 10:26 PM, SCP-6113-1 appeared unnoticed in an unpopulated portion of Site-17, disguised as Site Director Thomas Graham. SCP-6113-1 made its way to Dr. Brandon Fisher's office, mimicing his behavior perfectly so as to remain undetected.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Still disguised, SCP-6113-1 then requested Dr. Fisher's Level 3 Access Card for "security purposes." Despite the suspect reasoning, Dr. Fisher granted SCP-6113-1 his Access Card before returning to his terminal. SCP-6113-1 then left Dr. Fisher's office and walked towards the Low-Security Humanoid Containment wing. When alone, SCP-6113-1 took the opportunity to disguise as Dr. Fisher. This was captured on surveillance cameras, and security personnel were alerted.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]At 11:03 PM, a full site lockdown was ordered by Site Director Graham. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") was deployed, with an ETA of approximately 10 minutes. SCP-6113-1, still disguised, arrived in the humanoid containment wing and requested to meet with SCP-6113-3. Approximately half of the guards stationed in this wing were absent, attending to the lockdown order. Again, despite the suspicious circumstances, the guard allowed SCP-6113-1 into SCP-6113-3's containment cell. This was captured on surveillance cameras.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Upon entrance, SCP-6113-3 reacted with alarm and anger, shouting several expletives. SCP-6113-1 then disappeared for a few moments before returning with a woman, presumably Dr. James Park. SCP-6113-3 was shocked, yet calmed immediately. The following exchange is logged below:[[/span]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** James...?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** It's... Janet now.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Holy fucking shit, your egg cracked![[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** No thanks to you. <smiles>[[/span]]
**パーク博士:**

**SCP-6113-3:**

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** So, what's the plan?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** We break out with -2's help.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Then?[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Park:** ...For once in my life, I've got nothing planned after that.[[/span]]
**パーク博士:** 

= [[span class="o"]]//<SCP-6113-3 grabs Dr. Park's hand.>//[[/span]]
= //<>//

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-6113-3:** Well, lead the way.[[/span]]
**SCP-6113-3:** 
[[/div]]

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park both left two documents and three labeled photos on the containment cell's desk. The group left the containment cell as security personnel approached their position. SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park then sprinted in the opposite direction.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]At 11:12 PM, MTF Lambda-69 arrived in the humanoid containment wing, in front of the group. MTF Lambda-69 engaged the group, firing non-lethal ammunition. All projectiles, however, harmlessly collided with their bodies. SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park exhibited no pain response. One member of MTF Lambda-69 then vocalized several thaumaturgical incantations in an attempt to disable SCP-6113-1's known abilities. These incantations were only successful in removing SCP-6113-1's ability to disguise, revealing its true orange light form. With SCP-6113-1's assistance, the group disappeared from view.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]At 11:15 PM, Site-17's lockdown order was lifted, and search efforts for SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park were initiated for all Foundation agents and applicable Mobile Task Forces within a 100 km radius. At 4:00 AM, the search order was lifted.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I am thankful for my time with the Foundation, and I have enjoyed working on the SCP-6113 project immensely. However, I cannot, in good conscience, continue my employment. The reason: SCP-6113-3. It was envy, she said. That the idea of being a girl for her was more desirable than actually being a boy. I didn't understand it at the time. Needless to say, my desire to be her mother shadowed my judgement. For the better.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I know I've been compromised. You will search for and attempt to terminate me. For once, I don't care. I love her and I will do anything to protect her. That includes what I've just done. Forgive me, but I did what I thought was necessary. What I thought was "ethical."[[/span]]

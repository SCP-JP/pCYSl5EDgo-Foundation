I've always liked to give characters my own design, adding details or clothing that they didn't have before. For [[[SCP-1903]]] I decided to draw her wearing something other than the white dress she is always drawn in. I thought about it for some time until I came up with the idea of a long dark blue dress with white dots; I wanted her to be elegant as well, so I drew her with a scarf and some other details. SCP-1903 is, in my opinion, an article with one of the images that best represents the anomaly, and I think that's why I made this design one of my own. I hope to do more someday!

I made this piece back for the SCPtober in 2021. Sadly, I only could do two of the days (Favorite article and [[[SCP-ES-113]]]), but it was extremely fun to see everyone participate and submit their drawings. As part of the social media team over the hispanic branch, I got to spread a lot of the art done for it. Hope if it's done again this year more people might want to join in. 

Anyways, this piece also helped me realize I liked painting more than I originally thought. So that's another plus.

SCP-5000 is probably the article I can attribute that firmly cemented my interest in the SCP universe, and in a way instigated my future contributions off-site and on-site. So I thought, why not make SCP-5000 the second article to be featured in my more ambitious "Art Piece Wallpaper Series." and here we are :D

Thought of the composition of the image by visualizing the final scenes of the article, paired with the iconic message. Also chose a larger scale overall to emphasize the threat of going against the Foundation. Furthermore, also used it as an experimentation with lighting and compositing, specifically the backlit scenes. A testing ground of sorts for a thing I have yet to release/complete at this time of writing ;)

Well, what can I say about this one? Ever since I read [[[SCP-4179]]] I wondered what Clio looked like, and now I've drawn her! I tried to keep it as accurate to the original description as possible, while also including some ideas of my own. I especially like the vintage look I achieved here; it doesn't look too old or damaged, but it doesn't look perfectly preserved either. I think it gives this drawing an unique vibe that, in my opinion, perfectly fits SCP-4179.

I have no drawing skills and poor design skills. Nevertheless, I found a way to contribute artwork - with food art that no one has ever tried.

I ask carefully. Do you happen to have a forehead that can crack an egg? Do you have enough forearm muscles to squeeze ketchup? Then you have passed the first step of your contribution. Next step is to upload to the Wiki.

Don't hesitate!

Things began with a tale named [[[clown-breeding-101-with-prof-richard-c-normus| Clown Breeding 101 with Prof. Richard C. Normus]]], in which Icky was mentioned several times. This character caught my attention, so I went to get more information about [[[icky-the-magic-clown| this charming lady]]]. This character is not like many other Herman Fuller Presents, that use curiosity or deformity to attract people's attention, but tells the story of a girl who is a little different but still an ordinary person. So I decided to show the charm of this character in a very direct way, hoping that the audience would enjoy her shows as much as possible.

I wanted to put my experience at school to good use with this one, so I tried to make the designs more interesting, but in retrospect I think they look too steampunk - my whole goal with designing 2406 and the Mekhanites was to give them an ancient (think Shadow of the Colossus) yet advanced/scifi aesthetic, while also keeping practicality and historical authenticity (with regards to real Bronze Age design) in mind - as you can imagine, it's nearly impossible for me to juggle, so it ends up swaying one way or the other. All in all, though, I can't complain with how it turned out as it did; I don't plan on letting this obsession go anytime soon, so expect further iterations!

It took me a lot of time to find a special appearance for this particular [[[task-forces|Mobile Task Force]]]. Most of the well-known MTFs like the Red Right Hand, Hammer Down or Nine Tailed Fox have the same tactical style with guns and military vests, so I needed to find something to make this team's appearance more unique. Thanks to the famous SCP: Overlord movie by Ethan Royalty, I finally found the perfect appearance for the team. I tried adding an environmental background with a grass field and some kind of burning ritual cross (which I haven’t done a lot before) into the drawing, and it works very well to be honest, it made the drawing more lively and was able to demonstrate the purpose of the MTF. I think my future MTF artworks will often use this style, because of how useful it is.

//Three cards were drawn at random from the deck: the Ace of Cups ([[[scp-198| SCP-198]]] - Cup of Joe), The King of Swords ([[[dr-clef-s-proposal| SCP-001]]] - The Gate Guardian), and the Ten of Pentacles ([[[SCP-2847]]] - Yu the Great, and the Immortal).//
When I started drawing these cards I never thought I would finish a whole deck. But they are just so fun to design, so some time after I finished the Major Arcana, I began to draw the rest. I actually don't know that much about tarot readings, so forgive me if I totally messed up the meanings. I mostly picked the SCPs (and other themes) based on design and visual elements. I was actually super reluctant to use 198 for Ace of Cups because it's super gross. But it's also really memorable, and I'm glad I made it work. I'm proud of the King of Swords one since the garden gate behind the gate guardian matches nicely with the throne in the original card. And I totally picked 2847 for Ten of Pentacles just because I wrote it XD.

A girl and her giant murder-monster will always be a concept I enjoy, 053 and 682's friendship fits that bill perfectly. A young child, beholder to innumerable horrors and violence, still has the kindness and innocence to try and give her big, regenerating friend a band-aid to make it all better. And he lets her.
It is a bit older of a piece, a bit rough around the edges and from right around the time i was settling on a new line art and coloring style. Originally a very rough sketch for a shirt pattern, this evolved into the inspiration and character designs I used moving forward when I started making the 'Two and a Half Anomalies' series.
Regardless I'm happy how it came out and maybe I'll revisit the original idea and make a more refined version for shirt / sticker designs.

That's when I was trying out more of a portrait-like series. That was right before the pandemic started and after it started I took a break and my art is different now. I was originally gonna do more in that series but I took a break from drawing. I decided to do Miss Sweetie because she's my favorite SCP and I wanted to experiment with my design for her. The hairpiece is actually based on one from a game that I play that I thought would be cute on her.

This piece has always been a favorite. I still love the way the color palette turned out! I wanted to do something inspired by the fun CSS on 2744 but also wanted the scene to have a more low-energy mood so I added the blue to compliment. Right after I finished I made a bold claim to a friend that I that I had drawn the rat with the least amount of pixels possible while still being recognizable in any color palette. We spent 3 hours of heated philosophical debate trying to draw a smaller one, which we DID do.

This work is actually depicting the events occurring after the end of SCP-6659: the noospheric conflict between an idealization of humanity and the extra-noospheric entity. Much like the image within SCP-6659, this can be conceived of as an abstracted depiction of what's occuring in the noosphere. To stay on theme, the conflict is initially depicted using traditional Christian iconography; the armed angels of a god-figure cast the antagonist into the circles of hell. This common, recognizable imagery falls apart at the bottom of the work, where the other-ness of the entity disrupt easy parallels to existing mythology. Here, the void reaches through the brain and the star, ingressing into the familiar in this conflict of thought.

Or maybe it's the planet of the hands.

While drawing this third 5000 work, I tried to depict as many characters as possible from this wonderful story. There were so many things to draw, and hence the blockbuster-movie-like composition. What I can see from drawing Foundation artworks is that the SCP Foundation is a very attractive genre for artists: it has unique stories, characters, and fantastic entities. Sometimes they are hard to draw, but imaging them is undoubtedly a fascinating process. I'm glad I could partake in drawing this anomalous world.

All probably go with this unless you think there is a different one I should use….. As an artist Ive always been fascinated with the idea of drawing monsters. Its a unique opportunity you create something new but the truth about creativity is you have to barrow from other things you can invent a new color so to speak. So I try and draw from animals and all sorts of creatures I do my best to give these characters life and think what do I wanna say with this monster who are they. As much as making a monster is about making something scary if its just that then once you have seen it once where do you go from there.

This drawing of 5321 (by GrimmCreeper) was made in spirit of Sciptember for the very first prompt of ‘apollyon’. Honestly I was really inspired by the image used in it, and if you look closely the background of the character has that exact image. I wanted a focus on the AI as well as the very blue hues that popped out at you. Serene but a little alarming. It was really fun picking a dramatic line to use too, I try to captivate the watcher the same way a writer might by using hooks like that.

I was given the opportunity to make the banner for the 6k contest and it ended up being one of my favorite pieces I’ve made for the Wiki! While I usually consider myself a character artist, I’ve been exploring learning how to paint landscapes/outdoor scenes, and this was one of my first times really sitting down to do just that. At first I was a bit stumped by the prompt - nature is such a broad topic it was hard to narrow it down to one single image, but I ended up pulling inspiration from the nature I find myself hiking in every week - California’s amazing coastal salt marshes. I hope that when people view this piece, they find themselves standing there too, with the mud between their toes, the smell of salt in the air, and the coastal fog brushing against their skin.

"Milk Jesus" was inspired by a now-deleted article of the same name by DarnellJermaine, famous host of the Discovering SCP podcast. When I saw that Darnell was being digitally crucified in a manner not unlike Jesus himself, the flames of indignation arose in my chest and galvanized me to create this piece. I toiled away for three days and three nights in Blender, making sure every inch of the canvas conveyed pure suffering. This work, plus many others on my art page, have served as a way to show my appreciation for SCP authors. I hope that those who enjoyed "Milk Jesus" will also allow the same feelings into their hearts.

I love this piece most, it is different from my others. The drawing was for the last day of SCiPTEMPER, a reading and drawing challenge by Aethris on Twitter in September (her art are very good) with the tag: k-class-scenario, and I chose 6820. Because it was my last day of the challenge, so I add something different to this piece (more of digital painting instead of normal lighting) and it came out very well.

Hmm, what can I say about my art? Honestly I've never been one to think deeply into a concept until after I make it. This image was for Balthazaar for their scp 6k entry. I believe it's 6004. They asked for a snake and I made one because I thought reptiles are cool.  Same process for my comics. All have a loose idea then go for it. I've found that when I have a plan I rarely finish things so I live in the moment and discover what a drawing is and what it means while I do it.

SCP has been an amazing discovery, something found by accident that has made my art get better and meet a lot of new people. So this art piece I did for the SCP-6500 was an amazing opportunity to show my love for this community. I am glad I was able to contribute with my art for that amazing article.

This piece is probably one that I am most proud of, more refined than my usual ones,  it is also one in a long series of wallpapers. A wallpaper series that started out on the SCP subreddit then grew from there. I wanted to contribute something to the site but back then I did not have enough confidence to write an article. So I made an artpage instead by using and compiling my stuff from the subreddit. For a first on site impression, I think I did good. Then my SCP content evolved from there, to the realm of motion graphics and what not. This is what I love about the SCP wiki, the variety of media that it can be adapted to by anyone. :)

The lore of Sarkicism has been both an inspiration and turning point in my artistic journey. In this piece, I wanted to portray Ion, the founder of Sarkicism, in a way that his followers might have portrayed him.

Among the articles on this site, the ones that humanize anomalies and GOIs fascinate me the most - I feel they serve as a reminder that every side of a conflict has a story to tell, while showcasing the narrative creativity of a collaborative writing project perfectly.

This is the piece I did for Rounderhouse’s fantastic SCP-6000. I warned him that if we went for this idea, some people would get thirsty for the snake lady. But we proceeded, headfirst into the abyss. It did come out well though, all things considered. Jokes aside, I’ve loved SCP since the days of old creepypasta. Though all the images I’ve done for SCP so far have been commissioned by (very talented) writers, I’m planning on making my own article. I’m a visual storyteller so it will probably be a short unimpressive text with a nice creepy image that drives it forward. Hey, just like those old-school articles!

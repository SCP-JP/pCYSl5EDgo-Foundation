Site-04K of the SCP Foundation Korea Regional Command was established in Geonbongsan Mountain, Goseong-gun, the northernmost part of Gangwon-do, for the purpose of complete surveillance and removal of the paranormal blind spots. Site-04K is monitoring the North Korean border area and the coastal border for that purpose. Site-04K's observation posts can control the surveillance system (long-range camera), detection system (iron fence light network sensor), and control system of the ROKF(Republic of Korea Armed Forces).

The surveillance system operates as intended by the site in case of an emergency, and at this time, the camera display in the situation room of the Korean force is censored and only black screens are displayed. ROKF usually understands this situation as signal paralysis or failure, so no additional cover story work is required. If the observation posts send a false signal and the Korean Task Force is dispatched, the foundation can use it for special operations.

Site-04K was used only as a monitoring site for several decades after its establishment, but the regional characteristics that are difficult to access and the security added to the surveillance network of the Korean military were highly evaluated, and even carried out research and other duties. Since it has the advantage of protecting research results from external forces, the establishment of departments has been promoted and achievements are being made in various fields.

> Access to Site-04K is also difficult for the inspection department, so the number of inspections is inevitably smaller than that of other sites. It is not only the main site but also the scattered observation posts, which is much more restrictive in this case. As it is an environment in which it is easy to conceal incidents such as abuse between personnel, so the site was officially classified as a command blind spot.

> Inspectors general must carry out his duties carefully. New guidelines will be directed to replace the daily standard inspection procedures.

All facilities under the Site-04K are equipped with underground facilities and are designed to hide entrances in case of an emergency.


  **Surface Complex** -- Living facilities, Security posts, Garrison.


  **Elevator Shaft** -- Elevators and stairs are located.


  **B1, Dormitory Facilities**


  **B2, Depot**


  **B3, Operation and Research Wing** -- It also serves as an administrative facility.


  **B4, Containment Wing** -- It also serves as a PoI and D-class detention. Class Keter entities are handed over to other nearby sites.

Each observation post is systematized to withstand at least 14 days even if the supply is cut off immediately.


All observation post conduct underground evacuation drills at least twice a year. In the event of an emergency, administrative personnel must remove all confidential documents on the top floor and hide the entrance. At this time, the personnel who were patrolling outdoors hide themselves or move to the main site while maintaining communication with the observation post until the end of the situation.

**04-1 Observation Post ~ 04-█ Observation Post** -- [REDACTED] also serves as SCiPNET-KR data center.

**04-█ Observation Post ~ 04-█ Observation Post** -- These Posts also serves as research and containment.

**04-█ Observation Post ~ 04-7 Observation Post**

The 04-8 observation post is located in the direction of ○○-dong and is the only SCP Foundation facility in the DMZ. It was founded for the purpose of [DATA EXPUNGED] and is connected to ○○○ tunnels, so transportation and transportation are much easier than general observation posts.

ROK Armed Force Monitoring Department worked as DMZ Monitoring Department[[footnote]]At that time, the logo had an image of an iron fence instead of a circular element.[[/footnote]] at the beginning of its establishment. At this time, most of the personnel were scattered in each GOP company to carry out infiltration missions, but over time, the game changed as the scientific boundary system was established in the ROKF.

After the successful hacking of the ROKF surveillance system, the mission scope of the department was expanded to the entire DMZ, and recently it was upgraded to the ROKF Monitoring Department as it could operate outside the border with North Korea. Their technological value has been revealed by operating in places unrelated to the military, but the need for direct infiltration operations remains, so external work is only providing remote support.

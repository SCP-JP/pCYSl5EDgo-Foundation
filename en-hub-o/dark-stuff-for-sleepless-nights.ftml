Heya heya heya! I'm [[*user DarkStuff]], as might be **blindingly** obvious given the CSS and the title. I'll make this intro short. I have been commissioned by [[*user nosleep]] to make creepypastas at a regular rate. His specifications are that I make them based on singular mainlist SCPs, and that they can work as standalone articles. They're for his YouTube Channel, [*https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHD4P6lZNNt8vzfHlIOoXg Dr. SCP], for him and his team to add narration, animation, and sound to. To be transparent, it's not content //I// would consume, but what do I care? It's giving me a great reason to write weekly spooOOOOoooky stories, and I am having a //ton// of fun with it.

So really, there isn't anything else to say here. This is obviously where I am going to collect them all, so that someone who wants to read my creepypastas can use this hub to find them. Due to the (ahem, //ostensibly//) weekly nature of this arrangement, expect this hub to grow //rather fast.// As long as this arrangement holds up, this is eventually going to become a pretty large part of my authorship.

Soooo... here you are! In reverse chronological order:

* [[[The Mind as a Canopic Jar]]]
* [[[Baby Don't Hurt Me|Get a Room]]]
* [[[Tube Slides]]]

A squadron of eight General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft (hereafter referred to as LTE-1004-Alpha thru LTE-1004-Hotel) that spontaneously appeared within GOC-controlled airspace in France on 7/4/2020. The Threat Entity visually bore no national identification, but otherwise superficially resembled ordinary F-16Cs. LTE-1004 also emitted trace amounts of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-arad Elan Vital Energy], making long range tracking via VERITAS possible, but difficult.

The Threat Entity possessed numerous ectomorphic[[footnote]]Refers to entities composed mainly of ectoplasm, often created during the death of a living organism. Colloquially known as ghosts.[[/footnote]] properties, the most notable of which being a semi-translucent appearance,[[footnote]]Note: //Even with our VERITAS and the counterconceptual filters, LTE-1004 appeared translucent. They seemed to have a sheen, too, hence why we nicknamed them the "Ghost Squadron."// - "Nosy" (87433400/1781) [[/footnote]] which made visual targeting with the untrained eye nearly impossible. LTE-1004 also exhibited low-level antimemetic properties which further impeded visual targeting, effectively blocking its detection from those unaware of its existence, and making it functionally invisible to those not tracking it via VERITAS.

Each LTE-1004 instance possessed numerous unique thaumatological capabilities which allowed it to accomplish feats deemed otherwise impossible for ordinary vehicles of its performance. These abilities were apparently achieved through the use of runes painted across each aircraft's fuselage and wings. The runes were believed to have granted LTE-1004 the following capabilities:

* The ability to fly at sustained speeds exceeding Mach 5.
* The ability to fly for indefinite ranges without the need for refuel.
* Anomalous radar spoofing and jamming capabilities.
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring Thrust vectoring] capabilities along the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal axes of flight, effectively allowing for vertical, horizontal, and lateral movement mid-flight through anomalous means.
* Spontaneous generation of thaumaturgic ordnance for onboard paraweaponry (autocannon rounds, missiles, bombs, etc.) and countermeasures.

At least one instance of LTE-1004, LTE-1004-Alpha, was confirmed to be armed with an eigenweapon[[footnote]]Anomalous weapon of mass destruction.[[/footnote]], carrying a thaumatologically modified AGM-195X SALT[[footnote]]**S**trategic **A**ir-**L**aunched, **T**actical[[/footnote]] Cruise Missile (+1Gen/AltGen-ALCM).

[[size large]]##2C4A78|**First Contact:**##[[/size]]

LTE-1004 was first discovered on 7/4/2020 at 2231 hours by Coalition early warning systems after receiving a distress signal from 483GOC, a Coalition logistical aircraft, which reported it was under attack by enemy aircraft over France. The Coalition aircraft was later shot down near ████, France, with all lives onboard lost.

Initially assuming the attack to be non-anomalous in nature, standard Coalition air assets from Area Maiden-4 in France were scrambled to intercept the entity. They would later fail to liquidate the LTE-1004 instances, which in turn then shot them down. (See Scramble Mission AAR)

> According to 483GOC, we were dealing with at least two to three F-16C's, which we thought were non-anomalous at first. We scrambled a flight of six F-35As, myself included, with standard air-to-air engagement loadouts.
> 
> **__Encounter Report:__**
> 
> It took us thirty minutes to get to where 483GOC had gone down, and I confirmed that the aircraft had been shot down. The cargo was a few klicks south of the crash site, unharmed. The TE didn't show up on our radar until much later as only two contacts, but they seemed very glitchy to me, often going in and out of focus on my instruments, and I even forgot what I was looking for a couple times. I religiously kept tabs on them as best as I could and even had my helmet's OCULUS switched on, but my other pilots all reported they were forgetting where it was on radar and in-person.
> 
> When the enemy flight was about 50 kilometers away, they then quadrupled in number on radar, outnumbering us by two aircraft. We were able to easily acquire locks on the enemy squadron BVR[[footnote]]Beyond visual range.[[/footnote]] at that point and started shooting our long-range missiles at them. Despite clear hits on all targets, the enemy squadron just kept moving, as if the missiles didn't do a thing.
> 
> Once we got within 30 klicks of the squadron, I figured these weren't normal fighters, so I asked Tower for bogey dope.[[footnote]]A military aviation term used to request target information.[[/footnote]] They couldn't tell me a thing, so I told everyone to keep shooting with their Sidewinder missiles. Again, all misses. It was after this point that the enemy squadron commenced their engagement on us. All eight of them quickly converged on us in a tight formation and immediately shot down one of my flight members, so I knew we were dealing with trained pilots. 
> 
> While dogfighting, I saw that they could move in directions that we couldn't, even while we were trailing them. They could move up, down, and side to side in impossibly agile maneuvers, getting tricky angles on us and dancing past our shots. I could barely see them half the time, too. All I could see around me were rainbow explosions and tracers from cannons, jets blowing up, and the occasional enemy flying past me on my VERITAS. 
> 
> I noticed the enemy was shooting far more missiles than what would otherwise be normally possible for a F-16. Even as we expended all we could on them to stall, they continued shooting us. As a former F-16 pilot myself, I knew they had fired far more than the standard combat payload of 6 missiles. I dodged about twelve, from one of them alone.
> 
> I was lucky to bail out before one of the missiles hit me and destroyed my plane in a rainbow-colored explosion. As for the others of my flight, they weren't as lucky.
> 
> **__Results:__**
> 
> The mission was a failure. All wings shot down, and the last thing I saw before I hit the ground running was an explosion near Area Maiden-4 and an alert that the base was under attack.

Whatever you guys come up with, make sure it's able to actually hurt these guys, because they flew through everything we gave them.

Immediately following the aerial engagement, Area Maiden-4 would come under heavy assault by LTE-1004, which proceeded to bombard the facility with air to ground missiles and bombs. At least 60 ground personnel at Area Maiden-4 would be killed in action during this raid. 

Due to the sense of urgency and highly dangerous environment around Area Maiden-4 (which would constitute a breach of the Second Mission (Concealment) if not dealt with quickly), and given that they were the only team present onsite, PHYSICS Division operatives of Assessment Team 711 "Problem Solverz" present at Area Maiden-4 assessed the situation and began forming a preliminary plan of action to liquidate the parathreat. Assessment Team 711 then began analyzing data from Area Maiden-4 surveillance and automated defense systems, and documented their findings.

> ||~ Parathreat Investigation||

> __**Special Observer:**__ 
> 
> "Hendrix" 20947361/711 
> 
> __**Overview:**__
> 
> Eight anomalous F-16C fighter aircraft exhibiting numerous thaumaturgic properties have appeared in Area Maiden-4 airspace. Within the last 24 hours, they have resulted in 60 Coalition casualties, the destruction of Area Maiden-4, and mass panic amongst the Coalition.
> 
> __**Parathreat Evidence & Investigation:**__
> 
> Concurrent to the air raid on Area Maiden-4, I activated my team to assess the situation and to determine the type and origin of the attacker aircraft, under the pretense that we could assist friendly forces in acquiring vital data on the threat entity. Because the area was still under attack, and due to the fact that the TE was apparently selective with targets caught in the open, we were unable to retrieve a vast majority of our equipment from the base.
> 
> Once geared up, we quickly vacated Area Maiden-4 and deployed all the equipment we could muster on an observation post outside of the base, most notably our long-range high-powered VERITAS scanning unit, which took much effort to bring out to the field. After watching the 14th TFS engaging seemingly nothing in the sky for about ten minutes, Agent Dawkins then suggested that we fit the counterconceptual filter module to the scanner in the event the entity we were dealing with was antimemetic. After doing so, the Threat Entity became visible to us. I've attached a photo I captured of one of the instances above.
> 
> The TE was seemingly spectral in nature and emitted trace amounts of EVE. While this made it possible to locate it on the long range VERITAS scanner, we needed to have the counterconceptual filter on at all times in order to to maintain a solid visual on the entity. Viewing the entity without the filter on was possible so long as you had your OCULUS on, but it was extremely difficult — Agent Dawkins reported he forgot what he was looking at using this method, at one point, but I observed that paying attention to the faint orbs of light allowed me to maintain focus on the TE. This leads me to believe that the antimemetic qualities function as a sort of "stealth system" for the TE, effectively making it invisible to those that are not paying attention to it.
> 
> We observed that the entity became intangible to the conventional weaponry deployed by the 14th TFS and Area Maiden-4's automated air defense network, passing through missile and cannon alike. We also observed the emission of EVE from the TE when it fired its own paraweaponry upon the 14th TFS and the base itself, which we noted was of the same frequency as the TE themselves. This, combined with the runes Dawkins noted on the fuselage and wings of these planes, leads me to believe that these paraweapons are thaumaturgic in nature. I am currently unsure if the entity's antimemetic camouflage system is related to the runes.
> 
> Finally, we observed the enemy flight was headed west at speeds exceeding Mach 1, and likely increasing. It is unknown where the TE is heading as of now.
> 
> __**Suggested Response/Requests:**__
> 
> We need to conduct cover-up operations for the engagement at Area Maiden-4 under the pretense of a French Air Force training operation, and report the 483GOC crash as a training accident in accordance with the Coalition's Second Mission Statement (Concealment). We should obviously secure its cargo ASAP, as the +2Gen and AltGen cargo 483GOC was carrying would constitute a Second Mission breach if found.
> 
> I am advising that we establish TFRs[[footnote]]Temporary flight restrictions.[[/footnote]] over western France, Spain, and the United Kingdom as a precaution to prevent additional civilian or military casualties from KTE-1004-Caliburn-Velveteen. It is a hostile and aggressive entity but seems to only target GOC/related aircraft for now.
> 
> We should prepare standard rules of engagement for the TE, most likely Level 5, as it is dangerous and highly efficient at aerial combat, and quite easily laid waste to Area Maiden-4. I'm recommending Immediate Liquidation for this one. This TE was immune to all conventional weaponry fired upon it and almost compulsively engages things as it sees fit, so we need to get with PTOLEMY and PHYSICS soon to conjure something up that's capable of hitting it.
> 
> Finally, we need to know where it's going. With the correct equipment at hand, one can easily perceive this TE, although the antimemetic nature makes it hard to track. Alas, it still exists, and it's going somewhere east, much faster than our EVEDARs[[footnote]]Term for EVEDAR Location System, a +1Gen/TanGenT equipment allowing for long-range detection of EVE. Commonly fitted on vehicles to supplement conventional radar.[[/footnote]] can track. Maybe our pals at the ICUST can (quite literally) work their magic and help plot a course for the TE.

Following the attack on Maiden-4, a joint PTOLEMY and PSYCHE Division task force deduced that the only means of properly locating and liquidating LTE-1004 would be via thaumaturgic means.

Thus, Operation Icarus was planned, created, and executed, with the goal of liquidating LTE-1004 in a timely manner. Strike Team 1781 and Assessment Team 711—the newly-formed Task Force Icarus—would be tasked with ensuring the liquidation of the Threat Entity. 

The objectives of TF Icarus, therefore, were threefold:

# Establish a means of properly locating LTE-1004 through thaumaturgic means.
# Establish an effective delivery system for a thaumaturgically-modified paraweapon capable of liquidating all LTE-1004 threat entities in a timely manner.
# Liquidate LTE-1004.

|||||||| Sir, _
 _
To answer your question succinctly, yes. We have located the TE, we have made ample progress in determining its nature in order to liquidate it in a timely manner, and we know where it is heading. Though, I am afraid I have some bad news with this report as well. _
 _
Firstly, we now know from the Problem Solverz that the TE is ectomorphic in nature. All conventional weaponry fired upon thus far has failed to affect it whatsoever. Its antimemetic qualities have additionally made tracking it via conventional means extremely difficult. Because of this, PHYSICS first elected to deploy thaumaturgically blessed surface-to-air missile systems to shoot the TE down. Unfortunately, we currently do not have any readily available systems capable of targeting aircraft flying at hypersonic speeds—aircraft that, lest we forget, are also capable of impossibly agile maneuvers. _
 _
Secondly, my latest proposal—which we have since signed off on, was to fight fire with fire so to speak. We plan on scrambling an identically-sized Strike Team flying thaumaturgically modified F-22 fighters, while also fielding standard anti-ectomorphic equipment and weaponry. I chose Strike Team 1781 due to their prior experience with liquidating airborne parathreats. Acting as support for the squadron will be an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-3_Sentry E-3 Sentry AWACS Plane] fitted with a Scranton Reality Anchor and standard anti-ectomorphic equipment for combat support. All pilots involved //need// to have counterconceptual filter modules fitted with their [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-equipment OCULUS units], as Agent Hendrix has informed me that tracking the TE visually is virtually impossible due to its antimemetic nature. _
 _
Finally, our Type Blue assets from the ICUST, in conjunction with our SIGINT teams, were able to triangulate the location of KTE-1004 by conducting long-distance EVEDAR scans, ESP, and a thaumaturgic ritual in tandem. We now know the TE was last seen crossing the 30th Meridian West at speeds exceeding 6237 km/hr. _
 _
And now the bad news. We've identified one of the fighters as being armed with an eigenweapon, and it's carrying a SALT missile as its payload. As for its destination, all models plotted see the TE reaching one location: New York City.||

+ ##2C4A78| PHYSICS Report##
++ ##2C4A78| Liquidation ##

At 0100 hours on 7/5/2020, LTE-1004 was detected by Task Force Icarus, crossing the Atlantic Ocean at speeds exceeding Mach 5. Its intended destination was plotted to be New York City. This, combined with the fact that LTE-1004-Alpha was identified to be armed with an eigenweapon, led the Coalition to believe that LTE-1004's mission was to execute a SALT missile strike on the city and/or the United Nations headquarters there. Thus, all major Coalition administrative and defense assets in the United States were placed on high alert.

At this time, ST-1781 "Free Birds" would be mobilized from Area Renegade-8 to intercept LTE-1004. The team would consist of eight thaumaturgically modified F-22 Raptor stealth fighters engraved with similar runes to the TE. This was theorized to give ST-1781 the capability to properly engage each LTE-1004 instance on equal or greater standing. Acting as combat support for ST-1781 would be one E-3 Sentry AWACs, fitted with a Scranton Reality Anchor and four AN/X-43Q Anti-Ectomorphic Electromagnetic Devices.

ST-1781 would intercept LTE-1004 on 7/5/2020, with an engagement commencing at 0637 hours. A dogfight would ensue, in which three aircraft of ST-1781 would be shot down, while all enemy combatants were confirmed to be liquidated.

> 
> {{**Skyking:** Yes, sir. My ears felt like they were bleeding for five minutes straight as they jammed us, and I couldn't communicate with my team for the time being, but we managed to pull it through once the jamming was over. I guess "War Pigs" was a fitting song for the occasion, though.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** How so?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Up until that point, I was under the assumption that this was just some lost squadron of possessed fighter jets, which we've seen before in the case of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-tale-sequence-uhec possessed tanks and the like.] I know I was under orders to neutralize the threat entity, but maybe, I figured, there was a way to solve this without any more violence. The fact that these were the spirits of //GOC// pilots changed this, let alone spirits that spoke to us, and vengeful spirits, at that. I figured they were vengeful of some wrong the Coalition had done to them in the past, making me wonder what we could've done to one of our own, but I wasn't sure.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** This means that LTE-1004 is, according to your report, GOC Strike Team 1653 "Blackjack"?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Yes, sir.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** This is impossible, technically speaking.}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Why is that, sir?}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** According to GOC records, no such Strike Team exists, or has ever existed.}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** With all due respect, sir, that's not what I heard, and that's not what I discovered during my engagement with LTE-1004. Maybe 1004's antimemetic qualities extended far beyond just serving as a stealth system, but I'm no expert on antimemes.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** What makes you say that?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** At first, ST-1653 sounded oddly familiar to me, like something I had heard in the past. Firefox's voice sounded vaguely like someone I had known before, but that sense of familiarity has gradually become hazy to me following their liquidation. I'm pretty sure that this isn't a Ebbinghaus-class[[footnote]]Memory-affecting.[[/footnote]] parathreat, but the way it so quickly and so easily accessed our //secure// communications channel while also giving us a valid authentication code was astonishing. Obviously, I had to run to the most logical conclusion—that this was a GOC-created parathreat. The only other question was, then, how was it created?}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** Still, let me remind you, Agent Skyking, no such strike team exists on record, or has ever existed.}}
> 
> = {{**[Approximately ten seconds of silence passes. General Pratt clears his throat].**}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** Moving on, when you first engaged in combat with LTE-1004, you said you sustained a loss during the first six minutes of combat.}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Angel. Poor bastard didn't even have the chance to say he was hit when another magic missile hit him. We traded with LTE-1004, though, AWACS Nostromo informed me that Nosy had taken down 1004-Charlie in retaliation. Her expletives on the comms transcript confirms she wasn't very happy about the ordeal, but we all maintained our composure.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** How difficult would you say it was engaging the enemy squadron?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. My team is comprised of some of the best combat pilots I've ever known. We've braved countless aerial horrors, liquidated countless others, but there was just something about how we were engaging with //actual// aircraft for a change that made it seem more raw. It's difficult to describe this feeling, sir, but there's some intimate nature to dogfights like these.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** I served in the United States Air Force as a fighter pilot for 25 years, Agent Skyking. I know this feeling well. Please continue.}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Granted, these were ghost aircraft we were fighting, but the feeling was still there. I managed to shoot one of them down after trailing him for nearly ten minutes straight and watching him bob and weave past my cockpit, past everything I threw at him. I guess I got lucky, or the Ghostbusters were finally decreasing their combat effectiveness. It was 1004-Bravo, I think. All the while, Firefox kept taunting us and was evading all of my shots I fired at him.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** Taunting?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Firefox—or, rather, LTE-1004-Alpha—still had his comms open and was still communicating to //me// specifically, and his voice was becoming clearer and clearer to me as the fight progressed. I remember he kept talking, asking me if 'the lives being taken now mattered in the grand scheme of things,' if 'humanity was meant to be preserved if its own protectors weren't accountable for their own.' As I saw him shoot down Grail before my eyes, he started asking me if 'it hurt to see brother pitted against brother, sister against sister,' because 'this is the pain I felt being betrayed.' [Pause] All Strike Team operatives are trained to resist PSYOPS, as you know, but those words stuck to me. I couldn't think much of it in the moment because my team was dropping like flies and I needed to focus on shooting the TE down, but now, I think it makes sense to me.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** How so?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Something bad happened to LTE-1004 in the past, and Firefox never really gave me any details on it from our interaction, but he mentioned a LTE-2938-Spiral-Ragweed, quoting passages from a typical Threat Entity Database Entry as if word-for-word. I'm guessing that LTE-2938 was some space-time anomaly from some alternate universe or something, liquidated by ST-1653, and it may have had something to do with LTE-1004's creation. [Pause] I'm guessing that one doesn't exist in the Coalition database, either, sir.}}
> 
> {{**Pratt:** [Pause] I'm afraid not, but let's get back to the liquidation of the parathreat, please, Agent Skyking.}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** Right, after Nosy had shot down the Delta instance, I noticed the enemy formation split for a moment. Firefox broke formation and started accelerating away from the AO at full speed, heading towards the coastline. LTE-1004-Echo, Foxtrot, Gamma, and Hotel continued to engage me and my team, with some of them firing upon AWACS Nostromo. Thankfully, Nostromo was able to evade as it activated its electronic countermeasures, and Viper even shot down the 1004-Gamma, but Gnome was killed after defending Nostromo from the 1004-Hotel. I figured Firefox had realized that the Scranton Reality Anchor and the Ghostbusters were messing with his combat effectiveness, but I digress. We were now at equal numbers once again.}}

> {{**Pratt:** How effective was the AL-18 Tactical Laser System in eliminating the missile?}}
> 
> {{**Skyking:** It worked. Normally Generation Zero or Generation Plus One laser systems would heat the missile, causing it to weaken and eventually fail from the stresses of high speed flight, but this one completely burned through and disintegrated the target and left nothing left. That's probably why it was so effective in a last-ditch effort by Nosy to take down Firefox. I made note of this in my report, because I kind of like the AL-18.}}

> {{**Skyking:** Yes and no. I would've been essentially throwing the First and Third Mission Concerns in the trash had I not shot down the missile and instead focused on my own survival.

It painted a story of a unit wronged by the world and by the very organization it fought for, and made me think of what could happen if a similar situation to LTE-1004 happened to me... or if we were unsuccessful in our mission.

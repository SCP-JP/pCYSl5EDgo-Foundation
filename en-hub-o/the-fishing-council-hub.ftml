Hey Emma,

Thanks for sending along the artwork for the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-184 poster!] Word kept moving everything around when I put the full thing on the page, so I had to cut the bottom part off. But it looks good on the blog! 

It's great knowing a little more about what you get up to in Art & Artefacts.

Thanks,

Hi Greg,

Glad you liked it!

You do know that collage is just a hobby for me, right? And not what I do for A&A?

+++ __What it is & How to Come Aboard!__
@@ @@
Fishing Council is, ostensibly, a group of people from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-184 Site-184] that go on bi-weekly fishing expeditions. 

However, it's also about what Foundation personnel get up to in their free time, off the clock. For the various employees of the Foundation, the regular day-to-day work of securing and researching the anomalous is only one part of their lives. Fishing Council's a chance to explore the slice-of-life-style connections that form between these people in a space adjacent to their professional environment -- the fishing itself is entirely optional.

That or it's about some pals going fishing, up to you I suppose. 

-----

Currently, the series is broken into four groupings: 
* **__"The Great Fishing Saga:"__** A continuing narrative focusing on a specific group of people and one whale. I have some plans for this but am always open to suggestions/people getting involved. 
* **__"Fishing Tales:"__** One-off stories related to the Fishing Council at Site-184 (and/or other locations!)
* **"Fishing Trips:**" Accounts of Fishing Council members' experiences at Foundation Sites around the world. 
* **__"Catch of the Day:"__** Fishing Council-related SCPs. 

-----

Both the **Fishing Tales** and **Fishing Trips** sections are extremely open to anyone! And if you've got an idea for a related SCP or your own Fishing Council Series, that sounds super cool and I want to read it!

Fishing knowledge is not required! If you want to write something for Fishing Council go ahead and do that. As they say, there's plenty of fish in the sea![[footnote]] That's what that refers to, right? [[/footnote]]

[[tab Who's in Fishing Council?]]
The short answer: whoever you want to be! 

That said, there are a few recurring characters at Site-184 that make up the core group of the Fishing Council group, in no particular order:
 
* Emma: Transferred to Site-184, still getting adjusted with everything going on. Works in Anamolaous Art & Artefacts. 
* Sarah Colleart: The resident [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5516 lobster] expert at 184, may have a harder time with human social interactions. In a long-term relationship with Jennifer, who also works on-site in Art & Artefacts. 
* Henry Ivanon: Overworked and tired, got dragged into this, but not-so-secretly really enjoys this. Father of two young children.
* Greg Albsernester: A Foundation Naval Architect, and the biggest fishing enthusiast of the lost, Greg usually wears cable-knit and owns the Fishing Council vessel, //The Holy Mackeral,// and that basically says more about his character than anything I could add.
* Charles Cohen: A representative of the Dept. of Anomalous Communications and Relations, Charles has a 'winning smile' a can-do attitude, and employs copious usage of finger guns; if the Foundation thing doesn't work out, he has a job lined up at a used car dealership.
* Peter Lebedev: A 15-year-old boy, from WW2 Russia, currently [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-5597 stuck inside the body of a whale]. He's got some issues he's dealing with as best he can.

[[tab A Note on 'Fish' Council]]
The name "Fishing Council" came from a joke involving the plans for a series of works set at Site-72, a deep-sea Foundation facility for the research of marine anomalies. Aside from the ominous threats, they've been a great sport about it, and you can check their stuff out here:

+++ __What are they?__

Workshops and seminars held by various staff members on various topics. Critique, writing, dialogue, and more! The seminars are an interactive learning platform, and include activities and discussion to help keep everyone engaged and learning.

+++ __When are they?__

Each workshop/seminar will be announced //at least// 1 month in advance of the event itself in this thread, so you will be able to keep up with the schedule.

Anyone on staff may be the host of the event. The host of each seminar/workshop will be announced with the event's announcement itself.

+++ __How can I participate?__

Previously, seminars were held on #workshop of skipIRC. As of now, however, we are internally discussing the future of where seminars will be hosted. Updates will be posted, and we thank you for your patience.

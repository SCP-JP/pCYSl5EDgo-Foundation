**GENERAL HISTORICAL SUMMARY**
[[/=]]
The Medicean Academy of Occult Art was officially established July 16, 1484[[footnote]] The creation of an institution of the anomalous had been attempted by Cosimo di Giovanni de’ Medici “Il Vecchio”("The Old"), during the works of the Council of Florence in 1439, when he tried to keep Byzantine members of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#OI Janus Order] in town, but failed. [[/footnote]]. This was possible thanks to a papal bull by pope Sixtus IV, which gave to the lord of Florence Lorenzo de’ Medici the permission to “[...] found an institute that deals with training the most talented young artists in Italy, and making their work enjoyable and usable for all able men who are aware of occult matters.” The institute was born as a school for training artists, but in the hands of the de' Medici family it also became a formidable vector of diplomatic promotion for the Florentine state.

 width=200px
]]

The Academy remained property of the de' Medici family (excluding the republican period between the death of Lorenzo and the rise of Alessandro de' Medici known as "Il Moro", “The Moor”[[footnote]] During this period the Academy underwent a rapid decline due to the lack of interest of Lorenzo's successor, Piero de' Medici, and due to the action of predicator Girolamo Savonarola's supporters. Once the latter fell, the remaining members of the Academy placed themselves under the protection of the municipality, led by the //Gonfaloniere di Giustizia// Pier Soderini, who had already given asylum to many members. [[/footnote]]) following its fate and fortunes. Some perils threatened its existence, such as the attempt of the Grand Duke Cosimo III to sell it to the King of France Louis XIV. This was thought in order to be able to meet the expenses of his daughter's dowry. She, named Anna Maria Luisa, will be the last representative of the family to hold absolute power over the Academy. Through the so-called "Family Pact", she favored its independence from the princes of Austria-Lorraine, making it impossible:

//[...] "to take out of the capital and the state of the Grand Duchy, galleries, pictures, statues, libraries, jewels and other precious things, from the succession of the Most Serene Grand Duke, so that they would remain for the ornament of the state, for the benefit of the public and to attract the curiosity of foreigners. "//

Since then the Academy has slightly changed its face: no longer at the service of the Medici princes, it started an activity that we could define as a museum and the recovery of past art, according to the principles of the Enlightenment. This also started a wide diffusion of the Academy, not only in other non-catholic European countries but also in the rest of the world, reaching the continents of Asia and America.

With the birth of the Italian state under Savoy leadership the Academy, which until then had shown mild support to the Risorgimento cause, proposed itself as a reference institution in dealing with the occult for the new italian state with its capital now located in Florence. The Academy provided support to the activity of the [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/scp-121-it Royal Institute for the Unification of Italy]; however, with the conquest of Rome in 1871 and the formation of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#RIDIA Royal Institute of Italian Anomalies] (RIDIA in italian), the priorities of the crown no longer coincided with those of the Academy. Despite this brief moment of crisis, the Academy did not end up being absorbed by the Royal Institute. This was possible thanks to the donations made by the European aristocracy and the rich American bourgeoisie. Nonetheless, the Belle Epoque years were certainly among the most prolific and fruitful in the history of the Academy, despite the appearance of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/un-ballo-in-maschera new enemies] over the horizon.

The dull situation imposed on Europe during the Great War and its consequences led the European branches to a contraction of their strength and capacity of action. Conversely the branches in the Americas enjoyed a great deal of success, albeit within the limits imposed by the circumstances. During the Second World War the Academy managed to save itself from the fury of the conflict, even if many structures were looted by the [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/skp-portal german occult units]. Nevertheless, thanks to good relations with both the SCP Foundation and the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page Global Occult Coalition (GOC)], the Academy was able to recover most of the stolen works.

[[/<]]
Due to the extinction of the Medici grand-ducal line in 1743, the need to reorganize some positions within the Academy became evident: the Academy went from a subordinate institute meshed within the mechanisms of the old Tuscan state to a free and private institution. At the top needed to be placed a figure of prestige. The possibility for the Tutor of Florence, the most important among all the Tutors to become head of the organization, was stopped by the direct intervention of Anna Maria Luisa. In her will she decided that the person to inherit the position of supreme head was going to be the representative in charge of looking after the relations between the institute and the grand dukes, formerly known as "Curator hereditatis [[footnote]] Established by the Duke of Florence and then first Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I de' Medici. [[/footnote]] ". The new invested role with new powers was consequently renamed "Curator Academiae". Other positions that emerged did not change much compared to those of the past. In order, these are:
@@ @@
* **Curator:** Head of the organization in charge of managing the general finances of the institution and relations with the outside world. Despite this last assignment, he never reveals himself during official events, neither within the Academy nor with representatives of other groups. The office is elective, but neither the duration of the mandate nor the modalities with which it is granted are known. It is assumed that it's elected through an internal vote by all the Tutors of the Academy.

* **Tutors:** Representatives of each branch, the Tutors manage the internal activities of each venue and also partly coordinate relations with the outside world when allowed. The office is elective and has variable duration. Always chosen by co-optation from a group of names that have distinguished themselves within the Academy for merits and contributions offered to the world of art.

* **Supervisors:** Supervisors are generally experts in a specific area of competence, and hold some decisional powers over Assistants work. They maintain a certain transversality, and are not to be considered as mere bureaucratic executors of the will of the Tutors, but as deserving and honorable members worthy of being heard for their opinion.

* **Assistants:** All the members of the organization, whether involved into restorations or conservation or relations with the public are called Assistants, and are the beating heart of the Academy and its activities.

While maintaining its heart and its roots in Italian soil, from the time of its foundation the Academy has followed the princes and princesses of Medici family, spreading its influence across the courts of many powerful European nations. Consequently, it established itself as an institution universally recognized not only from the artistic point of view but also in diplomacy matters and international relations. After the second half of the eighteenth century it managed to expand even further away from the delightful Tuscan hills. To keep track of each venue and to keep relations between them as cordial and cooperative as possible, here are listed all the venues around the globe.

**Author's note:** It's quite evident that these are just some of the many Medicean Accademy's branches around the globe. These are some the official ones, based on -IT canon. Many others will be added in the future. If you want to add one more in your work, feel free to do it, but here will be listed only those appearing in italian works.

**Location:** Underground structure under the Zappeion, Athens, Greece

**Description:** The Great Hellenic Archive is the structure that houses the members and works of the Greek Academy of the Academy.
Although the Academy has operated in the Hellenic peninsula since the Ottoman conquest of Byzantine territories, the first plans for an effective operational headquarters only began in 1857, with an agreement between | //Reserved Information// |, the then Tutor of the Russian Branch, and the philanthropist Evangelis Zappas, with the aim of relocating various works (Greek / Hellenic art) to the newborn Kingdom of Greece.
Following the death of Zappas and a further agreement with the Hellenic government, the first foundations were laid for what is now the Greek Archive.
Today the Hellenic Archive houses ███ works, many of which have been relocated from other Academy structures.

**Location:** Underground structure beneath Palacio de Abrantes, Madrid, Spain

**Description:** The Iberian Archive, located in the capital of the kingdom of Spain, Madrid, proudly exhibits all the works found in the Iberian peninsula; however, it has a large collection of artifacts and works from all the colonies of what was once the Spanish Empire. It is one of the oldest seats of the Medicea Academy outside the Italian one: it came to be established in 1513, at the behest of the then lord of Florence, Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, future Pope Leo X. The future pontiff took this choice dictated by the political needs of the period: after the restoration of the Signoria in Florence, the Medici owed a lot to the monarchs of Spain, main supporters of their resettlement. By placing one of the Academy's venue in the new unitary state they would have strengthened relations and intensified collaboration and mutual support. The first seat of the Academy in Iberian land was located in Palacio de Benacazón, in the ancient capital of Toledo and remaining there for more than a century (it was dispensed from the centralization of institutions wanted by king Philip II by virtue of a papal dispensation from Pius IV, known as Giovanni Angelo Medici di Marignano). He moved permanently to Madrid in 1654 during the reign of Philip IV, at the current host building.

If you have come this far, it is almost certain that you are interested in contributing to Medicea Academy's activities. //Magnifico!//
If this is indeed true, we will inform you as soon as possible of the provisions and languages ​​that must be satisfied in order to catalog our works.

Compared to many other organizations operating in the anomalous and the occult, our institution has always been exclusively interested in any object of art worthy of being called such. What matters for the Academy are not so much the risks, or the potential that an artifact may or may not possess. The most important things are rather than the beauty and the ability to arouse the sentiment of the sublime in the souls of humankind. When a document needs to be drafted, this goal must be kept in mind. Scientific language does not specifically belong to our institution, even if in some cases it is necessary to use it as explained below.

To fulfill its noble purpose, the Academy not only takes care of recovering the artistic objects, but also restoring them back to their original splendor. It is for this reason that our Assistants are often skilled Restorers, to whom are given the documents relating our various works. They are not the only ones consulting documentations, but it’s crucial that conservational informations are always updated and scientifically precise.

Welcome to **The Void**. Down here, you're here to stay. But it doesn't have to be your punishment.

[[div class="indented"]]
**The Void**'s more malleable than most things most folks have ever known. It might look like a blank slate, but you can push it. With practice, you can shape it to your mind's eye (providing you haven't lost that along the way). What matters is, this place is yours and yours only. Others may come here; they may shape things the way they want. But there's no monsters. There's no doomsayers. And there's no one telling you how you ought to live.

Because that world's ended, baby, whether you like it or not. And in this place, where [[span class="THEY"]]They[[/span]] can no longer dictate your life, all you've got is a memory and your own imagination. And you can create some truly marvellous things.

But only if you believe it.

//A lone dancer in// **The Void** //dangles from above. She twists and tangles on strings extending into infinity.

+++ Cast
----
[[collapsible hideLocation="bottom" show="▷ Adamo Smalls" hide="△ Close"]]
**Adamo Smalls:** 31. Male. Portland-born. Former Jailors' accomplice as a memeticist with the Foundation Memetics and Infohazards Division. Operated with a speciality in analysing the emergence, proliferation, and impact of novel meme agents and memetic hazards, and in an advisory role as a Field Researcher with the Mobile Task Force Directorate. Displays archetypal irregularities consistent with “Mary Sue” typology (Unconfirmed). After prolonged testing with SCP-3309, his existence can no longer be registered.

Now believed to inhabit **The Void**.
----
[[/collapsible]]

[[collapsible hideLocation="bottom" show="▷ Heather Mason" hide="△ Close"]]
**Heather Mason:** 18. Transgender Female. Co-created by POIs 6881 (“hetcopogg”) and 6882 (“gaycopmp4”) of satirical leftist Internet community “Gamers Against Weed”. Former Jailors' captive as SCP-3090. Differs from baseline human physiology with a 24″-wide CRT television set in place of a head. Displays anomalous capacity to interface with and influence electronic devices via electrokinetic capabilities (Confirmed). First declared deceased after an internal containment breach at a Jailor stronghold, she is presumed missing.

Now believed to inhabit **The Void**.

+++ Glossary
----
Some of these I picked out — as it were — from your Jailors' toolkit. You may not like 'em, but they knew //exactly// what they were doing, and it's not good.

If there's more, don't hesitate to let me know. I'll keep this updated. All right?
----
* **narrativohazard:** A cascading hazard affecting elements of a narrative and its mode of transmission, often leading to their mutual destruction. Now, doesn't that sound inconvenient?

* **pataphysical:** We don't use it much, but you know it when you see it. It'll piss you right off, but when the imagined monsters turn real, you'll be glad you knew better. Don't let me indulge you. And more importantly, don't indulge [[span class="THEY"]]Them[[/span]].

* **The Void:** A substrate of “nothingness” and the foundations of observable existence. Entities that enter this place may find that their experience gives it form; that it populates it; that their perception shapes reality; and that imagination equals power. **The Void** is inaccessible for entities within the Cosmos (meatspace, dreamspace, et al.). Access can only occur through use of incredibly powerful narrative-bending manipulations. Entities who attempt these manipulations do, of course, face a high probability of incurring narrativohazards, or retroactively ceasing to have ever existed across their past life. Transit into **The Void** is inherently one-way — unless you somehow know better than I.

* [[span class="THEY"]]Them[[/span]]**:** The gods of the old world. The architects of our persistent peril. Formerly known as “The Authors.” That was a lie then, and it's a lie now. Truth is, you can kill 'em. But only if you can find 'em. I'm sure they wouldn't put up too much of a fight, though. Not inside their pitiable domain, at any rate.

You're asleep. Or maybe you skimmed all this. Or maybe you scrolled down here first.

Ah, well. I should have expected this.

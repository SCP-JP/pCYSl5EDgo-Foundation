[[size large]]Executive Memorandum Concerning Project Palisade[[/size]]
[[/=]]

I'm sure you've all heard the news, received the notices, or been given new orders. As of today, all former project resources formerly devoted to Forward Insight have been transferred under direct control of Palisade.

Many of you out there will privately question this decision. Some of you will even openly do so. And a small, isolated group of you may even declare us to be monsters who have forgotten our central mission.

But the simple, brutal, cold truth is: Palisade is our only hope.

To save the lives of many, we must sacrifice a few. This has been one of the cornerstones of the Foundation since its inception. And when dealing with the scale of this monstrosity, then the definition of "few" must be expanded as well.

To compromise this would mean nothing less than the death of all reality. The lives of too many innocents rely on us to allow this last moral quibble to undermine all that we have done.

They must die in the dark, so that we can continue to defend the light.

------

In a UIU secure prison, a Foundation agent materializes out of the aether. A mysterious figure stumbles upon a Foundation blacksite harboring a secret so terrible that it could threaten reality itself. The Black Queens prepare to utilize a weapon of last resort, not knowing its true origins. The corpse of a fallen giant rots in California, showing flashes of alternate realities.

All signs point towards Project Palisade. What lies at the heart of this dark conspiracy?

What would you sacrifice if it meant stopping the end of the universe?

Project Palisade is meant to be read in the order presented here. While the story is understandable when read out of order, we believe that it has the strongest impact when read sequentially.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the larger universe established here in Palisade, but we'd love to see what you want to add to it before you post. Feel free to contact [[*user weizhong]] with any questions about Palisade!

= //"Systematic Containment with Playability"//
Site-418, the Foundation's first (and currently only) virtual containment facility, is built within the popular video game Minecraft, and is responsible for containing anomalies that are difficult to contain in the real world, such as informational para-organisms, as well as monitoring organizations and anomalies of concern that exist within Minecraft and the surrounding community. Most containment, experimentation, and maintenance work at Site-418 is done by the Minecraft Division, a division of the Foundation that specializes in containment and research relating to Minecraft.

When it was first designed, Site-418 (then known as Site-M1) was built to contain [[[SCP-4335]]] exclusively, and was not intended to contain any other anomaly. Initially, it was thought that there were so few anomalies in the game that there was no need to create an entire department specifically for Minecraft. However, as Minecraft saw a resurgence in popularity, several anomalies surfaced within the game and the surrounding community, so Site-418 was redesigned to accommodate them. Initially, Site-418 was to be treated as a secondary facility to Site-15, but due to speculation of possible interference caused by [[[SCP-4645]]], plans were revised and Site-418 was designed as a series of standalone containment facilities.

The main mission of Site-418 is to monitor and contain anomalies that exist in Minecraft, and to house physical anomalies that are deemed extremely difficult to contain in physical Sites that have been transferred into Minecraft using SCP-████. Owing to its popularity and the relative creative freedom the game gives to its players, Minecraft has become a popular medium for anomalies. In addition, some Groups of Interest regularly engage in anomalous activity on Minecraft servers. As a result, the Minecraft community was determined to be a worthy target of Foundation surveillance, and the Minecraft Division, a department dedicated to investigating and containing them, was established.

Minecraft is a survival game developed by Mojang, a subsidiary of Microsoft, which allows for players to set up their own multiplayer servers. As mentioned earlier, the existence of multiple anomalies based in Minecraft has been confirmed by the Foundation. However, since the base game itself does not possess any anomalous qualities or pose any threat, no attempts have been made to contain Minecraft as a whole at this time. Interviews with Microsoft executives also revealed that Microsoft did not interfere in any way with the creation of these anomalies; however, due to the discovery of multiple anomalies that appear to originate from Microsoft (such as [[[SCP-892]]], [[[SCP-4943]]], etc.), and the company's policy of keeping much of its technology a secret, it is speculated that the company is somehow involved in the creation or maintenance of several anomalies. As such, the Foundation is currently considering designating Microsoft as a Group of Interest.

++ **Site-418-δ Layout**
[[/=]]
----
Because Site-418 consists of virtual containment facilities, it can be built without restrictions posed by the presence of other buildings or safety regulations. Because of this, several staff members have been freely building onto and decorating Site-418-δ in their free time. As a result, the structure looks very complicated on the outside, though it is actually designed to be practical and convenient to some extent.
[[=]]
+++ **Floor 01**
[[/=]]
The first floor of Site-418-δ is located at y=42 through y=54 and consists of living quarters for staff, a book depository with filled reports, a farm, and a cafeteria. No anomalies are contained in this area.
[[=]]
+++ **Floor 02**
[[/=]]
The second floor, located between y=54 through y=77, is where the bulk of experiments take place. Containment cells and experimental facilities made of obsidian have been created. There is also an inter-server transfer portal, which allows for items to be transferred to and from other servers using an anomalous ritual; this allows for access to other branches of Site-418 as well as external servers.
[[=]]
+++ **Floor 03**
[[/=]]
The third floor exists between y=78 and y=90, and contains extremely dangerous anomalies, most of which are Keter-class. There is also a command-block-based explosive that can be operated only by the administrator to self-destruct the entire facility in the event of a severe containment breach.
[[=]]
+++ **Server Room**
[[/=]]
The server room hosting Site-418-δ is located in Site-81BB. Originally, it was planned for Site-418 to be built at Site-15, but this plan was frozen after the possibility of interference by [[[SCP-4645]]] was identified.

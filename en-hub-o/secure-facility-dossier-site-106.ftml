++ Facility Overview
[[/=]]

Site-106 was, for much of its existence, more of an obligation than a necessity. Due to the increased population of non-permanent residents in Florida during the latter half of the 20th century from the booming tourist industry, surveillance outposts were established in several major cities throughout the state. While Regional Command-352 existed in the Gainesville area, it alone was ineffective at providing coverage for the entire region.

Following the establishment of Site-309 in Orlando, Outpost-106 was put in place in Miami, with an existing, vacant hotel used to establish a surveillance facility. The original goal of the Outpost was to monitor anomalous activity in the Miami area, and then report it to facilities which could contain or measure anomalous phenomena. However, by the end of the 1970s, its purpose would greatly expand.

In the Summer of 1979, a mass outbreak of anomalous phenomena occurred in the Miami area, as far north as Boca Raton and down towards Ft. Lauderdale. Agent Hubert Ruyter, a Foundation psychometrist, traced these anomalies to an antique store near the coast, which contained a total of over 3 000 distinct anomalous items. A safety deposit box associated with the store showed the existence of dozens of similar facilities across the nation.

Together with Dr. Hyun-Ok Kim and Agent Robert Dewitt, Ruyter proposed the formation of the Department of Procurement and Liquidation, which would act as the Foundation's arm for conducting semi-legitimate business, i.e. the purchase of anomalous objects and non-human entities in the event that more traditional containment methods could not be employed.

Since 1980, Site-106 has functioned as Procurement & Liquidation's headquarters; however, their agents operate internationally.

It was dark, but the setting sun allowed them to make out maybe half of the interior. One wall was dedicated entirely to literature, from novels to comic books, while a rack of clothing sat towards the center of the store. A milk crate marked "Half-Price!" sat on a table, with some ratty-looking plush animals sitting in it. There were some articles of taxidermy above the bookshelves, but beyond that, there was darkness.

Kim noticed a cord hanging from a light overhead. Pulling it revealed the rest of the store; more clothing, more toys, and towards the back, more expensive articles. Kitchenware, ranging from drinking glasses to baking sheets, a statuette of a cat that looked like it was straight out of Ancient Egypt, and a case full of jewelry.

Ruyter walked over to the crate of stuffed toys. He touched one of them with a single finger… and fell down, gasping in pain. The sensations he felt — oil and wetness, yes, but also a burning sensation, one he hadn't felt so severely since he was inducted into the Foundation. Hatred. Pure, burning hatred.

Re: Proposal concerning SCP-6237

In respect to the cascading rising costs of containment and the failure of infiltrations of SCP-6237-B, the Department of Procurement and Liquidation proposes the following action.  SCP-6237-B is a publicly traded company; despite its anomalous aspects, it is as susceptible to economic strategies as are otherwise similar companies.  Therefore:

++++ Details of the Proposal:
* The Department of Procurement and Liquidation will orchestrate a multi-tiered hostile takeover of ERS LLC shareholders, utilizing numerous shell companies, until controlling more than 51% of the shares;
* Such action will allow the Department to control the Board of Directors and thus, the activities of SCP-6237-B.  

++++ Benefits:
* Containment can shift from the disinformation campaign and its extensive costs – both in resources and personnel hours – to the modification of SCP-6237-B’s activities, to better serve the Veil;
* With control of SCP-6237-B’s Board of Directors, the Foundation will have access to extensive ritual information and research which would benefit the containment efforts of unrelated anomalies connected to thaumaturgy and the occult.

He'd timed it so they were both about to take a bite; his mother had a French fry in one hand, his father had speared a chunk of chicken finger. Both morsels froze in place just inches from their faces as he tossed a fry to their dog, Prudence, who was waiting patiently on the tiled floor. She knew she didn't have to beg.

His mother spoke first. "You know we're not FBI agents."

++ Staffing Information

**Site Director/Procurement and Liquidation Chief:** Jean Skeates

**On-Site Personnel:** 153

Site-106's duties are almost exclusively devoted to the logistical operations of P&L, including planning travel itineraries, allocating funds, determining origins of anomalous items, and containing high-risk, high-value items. Staff defer to larger Sites in the region for major containment efforts.

P&L has four major sub-departments:

We're the legwork: the people who go to auctions, estate sales and Wal-Marts to prevent folks from buying anomalous kitsch. People in our group typically have training in various fields of appraisal (from paintings and pottery to trading cards and retro telephones) as well as antiquing, finances, marketing, and archaeology. With the advent of eBay and Amazon, our job's gotten both a lot easier and a lot harder; it used to be that you could go to an estate sale and buy someone's shrunken head collection for half their asking price, but now a shrunken head collection can fetch a few thousand online. We don't have to get up from our desks as much, but it's hard not to miss going out into the field sometimes.

Fun fact: supposedly, P&L was originally supposed to be Acquisitions and Liquidation, but a week before Ruyter put in the proposal for the department, someone else [[[scp-6269 | pinched]]] the name. So now we're stuck sounding like a support group.

After A&A gets their loot, they send it to us. We're basically what happens if you locked a few dozen //Antique's Roadshow// appraisers in a room with a bunch of cursed relics; after we get over the fact that we're utterly terrified, we get to work trying to figure out who made them, what they are, where they came from. Sometimes it's as simple as scanning a barcode to get the item number from the database of a Sam's Club; other times, we have to call contacts from across the world to get them to figure out how the hell a cavalry saber becomes radioactive if held by someone who's French.

After the items are analyzed, they get tagged and put in one of our warehouses; we have three large, climate-controlled spaces in the Miami area. We store a little bit of everything-- furniture, jewelry, toys, electronics... Warehouse 3 actually has a small greenhouse area, just in case we come upon some very hungry carnivorous plants.

More than once, we've had to buy more than a few trinkets from a junk shop. We've had to buy properties that had spectral infestation, or distribution rights to anomalous films, or entire corporations. N&L is here to facilitate that; we're the contract lawyers, the negotiators, the used car salesmen and the guys from Wall Street who were unfortunate enough to grow a conscience. We know the business, we know the rules, we know how to break them, and we're going to make damn sure that nobody else breaks 'em the way we do.

In simpler times, the Foundation occasionally allowed researchers to requisition relatively harmless SCP objects for personal use. It's a practice generally frowned upon these days, but D&L's requisitions system is something of a spiritual successor. Anomalous objects -- items too simplistic and non-threatening for SCP designation -- often have practical inter-Foundation uses, and we're responsible for seeing that they //get// used instead of just taking up space in one of our many, many warehouses. 106NET has a designated server allowing personnel from every Site, Area and Outpost to express interest in the items in our collections, and a budget-based auctioning system for determining who gets what. We're very popular at Christmas time.

D&L is also responsible for the decommissioning of anomalous objects, since the Decommissioning Department has much bigger fish to fry, goodwill item transfers to the Global Occult Coalition for destruction on their own terms, and the selling-off of non-anomalous assets generated by objects in containment.

++ Anomalous Item Requests
[[/=]]

During its operations, the Foundation occasionally recovers low-risk, even beneficial, anomalous items. In some cases, these are allowed to be kept by individual members of staff, or left in common areas; some, such as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-458 SCP-458], have been given full SCP classification in the past.

In 2008, despite having three different containment warehouses, P&L began to run low on space. As the Foundation at the time lacked the ability to distort interior space to be greater than the exterior space, and several items were deemed to be unsuitable for further study, Site-106 began the process of physically neutralizing several items; this was soon found inadvisable, as several items produced hazardous waste products upon destruction.

As an alternative, P&L began taking requests from other Sites and Departments for the leasing of low-risk anomalous items to their possession for periods ranging from three months to an indefinite duration. The contract was written in August 2009; by the end of October, P&L's warehouses only contained high-risk anomalous items which had resulted in multiple injuries or deaths in the past.

This program has continued to the present day; a catalog of anomalous items in P&L's possession, and a standard form for requests, are available to Site and Department Directors throughout the Foundation. These operations are handled by Distribution and Liquidation; by request of Assistant Director Perrault, a representative sample of the items on offer has been provided below.

**Description:** A small clay model of an unknown animal, with craftsmanship consistent with the efforts of a young child.

**Provenance:** Recovered from the home of one Billy Stokes, Findlay, Ohio. Subject was paid three dollars at a family garage sale.

**Anomalous Nature:** The object emits periodic trumpeting sounds when only in the presence of individuals possessing belief in supernatural phenomena -- such as small children, or SCP Foundation personnel. These sounds have been proven to produce an anxiety-soothing effect similar to stroking a pet cat or dog.

Hi there! I just wanted to put in a bit of quick info regarding using the content of Demasqed outside of... well, Demasqed. As with everything else I have ever put on this site, fan-art is always always always super appreciated! In fact, if there is any fan-art made, I'll add a section to this hub specifically for fan-art (with permission of the artists of course). Regarding using the characters or original creations from the series, I'd prefer you asked me before doing anything (I will almost 100% say yes), and my only hard no is that I don't want anyone to write an SCP for the Narrator Hornets. Other than that, yeah, please do what you want, and please let me know if you do make something for the series because I absolutely love seeing that stuff! Okay, enough of this, on to the actual hub!

Set at the top of the Broken Masquerade canon, Demasqed follows the stories of two researchers trying to solve the mystery of a project gone awry, and a team of ill-equipped scientists struggling to handle the unfamiliar openness of the Foundation and make a good first impression with the public.

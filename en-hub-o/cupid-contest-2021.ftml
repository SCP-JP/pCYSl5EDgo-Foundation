+ SCP Cupid-Con 2021!

+++ Happy Valentine’s day, everyone! By popular demand, welcome to our Valentine’s contest.

The criteria for this contest is very simple: Your article must be based around the theme of **romance**. That’s it - no hard and fast rules on what that might mean, but it is subject to judge interpretation.

**Posting begins on Valentine’s Day, February 14 at midnight EST and ends on February 21 midnight EST. The reading/voting period ends on February 28 at midnight EST.**

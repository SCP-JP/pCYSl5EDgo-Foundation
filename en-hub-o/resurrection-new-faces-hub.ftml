Director Sophia Light is in a precarious position.  Chosen to head a new Mobile Task Force made up (at least partially) by anomalous individuals by the powers that be, Director Light has a lot of pressure on her.  As we have seen so far, the recruitment and assembling of a team has gone slowly.  But Director Light has always felt that a singular team was the biggest flaw in the legacy of Omega-7, and she is insistent that in order for the MTF Alpha-9 ("Last Hope") to be effective more than one team would need to be ready to deal with emergencies.  It is in this scenario our story opens: Director Light is looking to recruit new members to her provisional MTF.

At the same time, an anomaly beneath a Site in Yellowstone has begun to wake up.   This object is left over from a previous Restructuring Event at the hands of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-zero-part-5 | SCP-076]]] and reality hasn't ever truly healed from that incident.

+ The Beholder Program

[[/=]]


[[div class="blockquote"]]
Hello, my name is Dr. Rynhart. I am the head researcher overseeing The Beholder Program. You have been personally selected to join this program due to your work ethic, interpersonal skills, and lack of major disciplinary violations. Welcome to the team!

You may not have heard of this department before, and that is partially due to how new this all is. Space was always thought to be an endless void that we would only ever get to see a small portion of, but with recent leaps in technology, space is within our grasps. We have engineers building the fastest rockets, programmers advancing the realm of artificial intelligence, and a few brave men and women who are willing to travel into that void.

This is where you come in. We need young researchers who are willing to get to work and collect as much data as possible. We have thousands of logs and images that have been collected from our Beholder line of satellites. You will be the backbone of this initiative, so are you ready to get to work?

So... what is this?

Well, this is a collection of articles centered around the strange, and odd things that live in space, and a sentient AI named Binary Star. The themes of these articles revolve around the curiosity of the unknown, and the curiosity of finding them.

With this being said, any article a part of this hub must be fairly grounded, so any anomalies attached to this hub must fairly limited in their ability to affect earth. Space is scary enough as it is.

The Foundation must also be naÃ¯ve to the inner workings of the anomalies. Space is big and weird. No one knows why or how these things exist, they just do. Any knowledge on the inner workings of the SCP should be hinted at, and not told bluntly.

Now this isn't to say you can't add a very powerful SCP, or a highly in depth article to this hub. It just isn't what the hub is all about. If you have any doubts just go ahead and ask if it works or not (this is encouraged if you want to intertwine your piece in any story line).

**Major Observations** are any articles that fall into the themes of this hub.

**Cosmic Events** are the same as Major Observations, but they are tales. This will be expanded on  in the near future.

If you would like help with an idea, or if you want to add to this hub, contact [[*user Sirslash47]]. Currently we don't have a timeline etc. so it is suggested to read the current articles to check if your idea is not conflicting already established events.

This hub uses the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:last-frontier | Last Frontier Theme]]] made by [[*user Vivarium]], and can be used for SCPs, and Tales in this setting (this is not mandatory). To import this theme to your page, put the following text anywhere inside it:

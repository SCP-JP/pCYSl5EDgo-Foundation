[[tab What is this canon about?]]
[[div class="log-header"]]
The canon "Cyców's Hell" focuses on the existence of a demonic layer of reality that is separated from us by a barrier. It just so happens that this barrier is the thinnest in the inconspicuous Cyców commune. Due to the anomalies occurring there, the Foundation quickly secures the area of the entire commune, later naming it Nx-79 "Cyców Commune", completely cutting it off from the rest of the civilization. Site PL-79 is built to oversee the entire area of the Nexus and to investigate anomalies related to the demonic layer of reality. It turns out, however, that the Foundation is not the only organization that knows about its existence. In the forest located in the village of Cyców, there are armaments plants belonging to Hunter Industries, as well as their headquarters. Where the Foundation deals with the study of demonic entities, these deal with using them for the development of technology and the production of weapons. They build their laboratories and factories in both our and demonic layer.

[[div class="log-header"]]
+++* Postacie
----
* **Director Antoni Grzmichuj** -- Director of Site PL-79 from 2003 to 2010. He was relegated to the job in postal room in the Legal Department, the reason for the change of position was the contract signed by him, unfavorable for the Foundation, with Hunter Industries. Proud of his position as director, he wants to regain it and does not allow himself to think that he is simply incompetent.
* **Brygida Wiśniewska** -- Foundation agent and Inquisitor at Site PL-79. Thanks to her, Antoni Grzmichuj is no longer the director of the Site. Firm, self-confident and not mincing words.
* **Director Kamil Szczur** -- Director of Site PL-79 after Grzmichuj. A young, confident man who wants to prove his worth. He tries to fix the errors of his predecessor and to avoid blockages imposed by the contract with Hunter Industries.
* **Dr. Konstantyn Jackowski** -- Head of the Demonic Department, seemingly incompetent, too loose and unfit for his position. In fact, however, he has the most knowledge in the Foundation about demonic beings and the demonic layer of reality itself. Working for the Foundation for many years, a thaumaturge, however, is not as deeply involved in this field as in demonology. Whiskey lover.
* **Adam Hunter** -- One of the two owners of Hunter Industries. Mainly dealing with the company's contacts with external persons. A calm and professional white-haired man dressed in white. He has psychic powers to make significant suggestions to the other person through eye contact.

[[div class="log-header"]]
+++* Locations
----
* **The demonic layer of reality** -- A layer of reality separated by a barrier that is a demonic reflection of ours. Inhabited by demonic beings, both those more intelligent, creating their own civilization, and mindless monsters. A characteristic feature of its landscape are white, slightly bloody fungal structures.
* **Nx-79 "Cyców Commune"** -- The whole area of the Cyców commune is classified as Nx-79 "Cyców Commune" of Dunwich class. Nx-79 is where the barrier separating our reality layer from the demonic reality layer is at its thinnest. People who commit suicide in the area of Nx-79 appear in the same state as at the time of death in the Cyców commune, but in the demonic layer of reality, which is much more dangerous than ours due to the presence of numerous demonic entities.
* **Site PL-79** -- The Foundation Site that was built in Cyców, its task is securing anomalies from the entire area of Nx-79 and those related to the demonic layer. It is also the headquarters of the Demon Department.

[[div class="log-header"]]
+++* Groups of Interest
----
* **[[[hunter-industries-hub|Hunter Industries]]]** -- The company was founded by siblings Amanda and Adam Hunter. The headquarters of Hunter Industries is located in Cyców. The company itself is engaged in the research and production of weapons and technology related to demonic beings and the demonic layer of reality. They have their laboratories and factories, both on our reality and demonic layer.
[[/div]]
[[div class="log-header"]]
+++* Terminology
----
* **EZAW energy** -- Anomalous energy obtained from demonic entities. Used in technologies and weapons from Hunter Industries.
* **Demonic entity** -- A name for beings from the demonic layer of reality. They are classified with the letters from A to E, this classification is used by both the Foundation and Hunter Industries. The higher the class of demonic being, the stronger its powers and the higher its intelligence. Class E demonic entities are extremely weak and mindless. Class D beings can be likened to animals. Threatening and strong, but acting on instincts. Class C entities are usually able to speak or communicate in other ways, not always stronger than Class D entities, but usually smarter. Class B demonic entities are higher demons, exercising sovereignty over certain parts of the demonic layer of reality. There is one known class A demonic entity; data about him is confidential.

[[tab So you wanna write something here?]]
[[div class="log-header"]]
Cyców's Hell is a canon about demons, cutting off the area of the entire commune from civilization, a company using demonic beings for its own purposes and a Foundation trying to comprehend all of it. This is most of the things you should know. You can find out about the rest, for example by reading the articles, or by asking the canon overseer ([[*user Zygard]]) via wikidot or discord (preferably discord).

-----------
**Who can write for this canon?**
-- everyone!

**Hey, I want to write an article for this canon, but the events are a bit different for me and it ruins other articles a bit, but I guarantee that this article is cool**
-- Ok, I'll just give a note that the work is non-canonical to the rest

**I wanted to do multi-canon drifting and use this canon to write a work that also applies to another canon**
-- If everything is consistent and you show me first it's cool

**Does this canon have a specific css theme that I can use?**
-- Not at the moment, but I recommend using [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:basalt basalt] with darkmode and with changed header for the Hunter Industries format. Like you can see in [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/zlecenie-mef-2839 Order MEF-2839]. For other articles you can use [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:flopstyle-dark Flopstyle: DARK] with changing few things, or simplier [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:jakstyle Jakstyle] with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:black-highlighter-theme black highlighter].

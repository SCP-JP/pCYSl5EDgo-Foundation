Welcome to the Required Reading Hub!

@@@@
The Required Reading Hub is the centralized location for both the most essential informational guides that all site users will need to help learn how to navigate the site, as well as the rules that all members of the SCP-Wiki Community agree to follow. While not all of these guides are rules-specific, all of them are essential to ensuring that authors have as pleasant a time interacting with the site as possible.

This page is not an exhaustive list of all guides and essays that have been posted to the site, but rather a collection of the small handful of guides that the SCP Foundation Wiki requires all site members to read. For a complete collection of all guides and essays, please consult the [[[Guide Hub]]].

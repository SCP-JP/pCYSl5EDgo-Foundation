**Site Function:** Site-43 is a research hub for acroamatic abatement and historical analysis, and the Foundation's largest Canadian research and containment facility. Cover-up and monitoring efforts relating to the surrounding [http://www.scpwiki.com/nexus-series Briar-class Nexus-94] are coordinated from this location.

**Founded:** 1 April 1943

**Founding Director:** Dr. V. Lesley Scout

**Location:** Ipperwash Provincial Park, Lambton County, Ontario, Canada

**Cover Story:** Lake Huron Supply, Control and Purification (water distillation and delivery)

**Size:** 372 000 m^^2^^ (floor area, subterranean) / 56 hectares (interdiction range, surface)

++ Site Overview
[[/=]]

Site-43 has a reputation within the SCP Foundation — not necessarily a positive one — for imaginative, adaptive responses to awkward containment challenges. 

[[f<image LHR2.png]]

Multiple anomalies are only partially contained, and dozens in the surrounding area are not contained at all. One has hounded a Site employee for eighteen years, and the effects of another are ameliorated by the creation of even more uncontained anomalies by a Person of Interest allied with the Site executive. In each case these solutions are the most effective, most efficient, and least disruptive available. Visitors from other Sites frequently find the wandering mirror monster, the lake full of man-eating panther chimeras, the annual esoteric effluence explosion and the self-replicating subterranean refinery disconcerting. Variations of the following joke can be heard at almost every Foundation facility: "Is it actually uncontained, or is it just at Site-43?"

This jibe effaces a remarkable fact about the Lake Huron Research and Containment Facility: set against Sites of comparable size, its containment breach record is admirable. Sustainable, rational approaches to often-unruly subjects crafted by a creative and engaged academic community are the true foundation of this relative success.

[[/div]]

Site-43's atypical containment philosophy is an artifact of its creation, the full story of which is told elsewhere. In brief: the need to uncover anomalies attested in historical sources which have not yet become Veil-piercing threats, and the need to handle the many thousands of tons of esoteric material produced by over five thousand SCP objects in containment, led to the establishment of a joint facility in a remote location with access to clean water. Ensconced in the bedrock under Ipperwash Provincial Park, the Archives and Revision Section has scoured history for anomalous events and the Acroamatic Abatement Section has scoured esoteric effluence of its harmful properties for over seventy years. The success of that collaboration led to an expanded academic network at Site-43, which in turn led to our present system of federated Theoretical and Practical Sections. The sense that Site-43, by virtue of its location in Canada, is the "backwater" of the Foundation's North American holdings has also contributed to its close-knit and informal collegiate atmosphere.

**On-Site Personnel:** 562

All activities at Site-43 are overseen by an Operational Section, either Theoretical or Practical. The Theoretical Sections behave as federated academic units, conducting research and colloquiums. The Practical Sections perform more technical work.

The "Chair" of each Theoretical Section is a staff member with PhD or MD qualifications; the "Chief" of each Practical Section is a staff member whose qualifications vary from field to field. The All-Sections Chief oversees all inter-Sectional interactions.

Per a request from the Records and Information Security Administration, to counter misinformation about Site-43 and encourage the growth of our academic community, the Chairs and Chiefs were asked to submit the informal "elevator pitch" descriptions of their Sections appearing below. For formal data, access the peer-reviewed publications appended above or contact the Hiring and Regulation Section via SCiPNET.

//The victors are written by history.//
[[/=]]
If the SCP database is to be believed, the Foundation is perennially late to the party. The police, the papers, the government or the public at large find out about most anomalies first, and we react. We clean up the mess, we amnesticize the witnesses, and we capture the entity/take custody of the object/lock down the location. Archives and Revision exists to reverse that scenario: we comb over historical documents, identify trends, and thereby discover anomalies which //have not yet caused a scene.// And when the dust settles, we re-write the official story in case someone else follows in our footsteps and makes the same connections.

Flip a coin. Heads, we're allowed to use anomalies offensively. Tails, we're not. Flip it again tomorrow. That's how the Foundation has handled the issue for the past few decades. Training anomalies to be soldiers, training non-anomalous soldiers to use anomalous weapons, or simply employing anomalies for tactical advantage isn't always an option. Our job requires flexibility, so our rules are flexible too. What //is// always an option is learning enough about the items in our inventory to replicate some of their effects for our own purposes. That's what A&E does.

Being trapped in a strange, confined space is terrifying. You feel helpless, alone, unloved and unwanted. The walls close in, and you wonder if you'll ever be allowed to leave. If you'll ever see your loved ones again. At Psychology and Parapsychology, we help to ease those feelings of fear, guilt, worry and disgust. We offer the same service to our subjects in containment.

In layman's terms, the Quantum Supermechanics Section does insane nonsense. Only the highest-level researchers in the Section can comprehend what we do in technical terms. In between, there's this explanation: we study minute variations in the rules governing our universe, and the rules governing universes which are not ours, and the rules governing universes which do not exist, and exploit the differences for scientific gain. If that made sense, you're either in the wrong Section or reading the Secure Facility Dossier when you should be working on the quantum gravity problem.

New Foundation personnel are often overwhelmed by the scale and scope of the paranormal world.

If they can't disabuse themselves of that idea after a few weeks, they won't be forgiven any longer. If they can't disabuse themseves of that idea ever, they come to work at Theology and Teleology, where we digest mythology and excrete scientific gain.

Academics are inherently disorganized and unsociable. They bicker, they feud, they hold grudges and symposia. At H&R, we develop the human resources equivalent of Special Containment Procedures to keep them in line: protocols, paperwork, training and performance reviews.

Academics need to eat, sleep, and be merry. They don't always know when, or how, they should do those things. H&S is responsible for making sure our personnel don't fall down on the job, because if we do fall, the world falls with us.

You know what we do. It's in the masthead. Those three words that are so familiar, you roll your eyes when someone says them out loud. Securing, containing, and protecting is such an obvious part of our lives, the background noise of our employment, that it's easy to lose sight of what it really means. And that's when people get hurt. We think about containment breaches every day, so you never have to see one.

(The Stars on My Wall Have Never Looked This Way Before)

[[size 150%]]**Verse I**[[/size]]
Just like the stars guiding me
When there's no way home
Without you next to me dear
I feel so alone

I can make out your light
With a smile on my face
The stars bursting in my eyes
As I look into space

[[size 150%]]**Pre-Chorus**[[/size]]
As I bid farewell to all that I know
Billions of miles away from my home
Away from it all
Into the unknown

And now we're off
To the far off lands
And while I may not know where we are
I am guided by your hand

[[size 150%]]**Chorus**[[/size]]
And now I'm dancing on the starlight
With you In my hand
I hold you so tightly
Oh it feels so grand

And now I'm dancing on the starlight
As static fills my dreams
I hear what you say, dear
I know what it means

[[size 150%]]**Verse II**[[/size]]
And so I turn on the ignition
Listen to the engine purr
I'm on the highway now
I feel my heart begin to stir

Now it's time for liftoff
My car is in the air
The smoke flows from the tailpipe
I feel it flow through my hair

[[size 150%]]**Pre-Chorus**[[/size]]
And now I'm gone
Up into space
I'm almost there
I can see your face

I feel a surge of joy
I feel my heart begin to beat
I feel so close to you dear
We can finally meet

[[size 150%]]**Chorus**[[/size]]
And now I'm dancing on the starlight
With you In my hand
I hold you so tightly
Oh it feels so grand

And now I'm dancing on the starlight
As static fills my dreams
I hear what you say, dear
I know what it means

[[size 150%]]**Verse III**[[/size]]
I feel so weightless
Up here alone
I'm soon arriving
To my new home

Your beauty is upon me
I can feel it now
My heart just skipped a beat
I can't help but take a bow

[[size 150%]]**Pre-Chorus**[[/size]]
And now I'm finally here
I'm standing by your side
I don't need a ring because
Darling, you're finally mine

Oh how your beauty sings
Your charisma radiates
I don't care what the others say
Because my love dominates

[[size 150%]]**Chorus (x2)**[[/size]]
And now I'm dancing on the starlight
With you In my hand
I hold you so tightly
Oh it feels so grand

And now I'm dancing on the starlight
As static fills my dreams
I hear what you say, dear
I know what it means

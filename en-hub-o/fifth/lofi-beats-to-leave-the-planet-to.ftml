+ "Away From This Place"  
+++ by Youthful Galaxy

Hey, how’d we get here again?

Oh right.

~

Tyrants watch from behind the scenes
As they pacify magic and nullify dreams
Fed by politicians and watered by liars
Poisoning your mind and putting out fires
The shadows of a secret world, hidden away
Make the world such a scary place to live today
They’ll lock you in prison for telling the truth
They’ll erase the dissenters and demolish the proof
They give people numbers and throw ‘em in a cell
Put walls around heaven and a gate around hell
If you want my advice, you can follow my plan
Let’s run to the stars as fast as we can

~

There’s new home across the night sky
Gather with me, tomorrow we’ll fly
A new galaxy where we can embrace
Baby let’s get away from this place
Keep your love pure and your mind free
Come on this adventure with me
A brand new home out in deep space
Baby let’s get away from this place

~

All the big wigs are just hapless sheep
This conspiracy is real and runs pretty deep
Inside every government, business, and brand
You’ll find the strings that lead back to the hand
Puppet masters fight their secret war
Creating a world that we all deplore
Top to bottom, it fills with their rot
But there’s no need to cry or be distraught
A magical place waits far from the sun
We’ll make a fresh new slate for everyone
A new planet made for me and you
Let’s run there baby, and start anew

~

There’s new home across the night sky
Gather with me, tomorrow we’ll fly
A new galaxy where we can embrace
Baby let’s get away from this place
Keep your love pure and your mind free
Come on this adventure with me
A brand new home out in deep space
Baby let’s get away from this place

[[collapsible show="+ About the artist" hide="- Youthful Galaxy"]]

Youthful Galaxy is an emerging artist in the growing Fifthist rap scene. Fiercely independent and known for his lo fi aesthetic, Galaxy actually got his start as a protest rapper more closely affiliated with Are We Cool Yet? and Gamers Against Weed before leaving those communities to forge his own path. After fully embracing the Fifthist aesthetic, Youthful Galaxy made some lo-fi essentials like his albums //Starsleeper// and //Alien Girl//. This single "Away From This Place" is from his //Silent Secrets// album, of which only one copy was printed. The album was sold at a special auction in New York City. This single has been released with the permission of the owner of the record.

+ [[span class="o"]]Character sheet: Marion Wheeler[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Marion Audrey Wheeler //n√©e// Hutchinson is the protagonist of //[[[antimemetics-division-hub|There Is No Antimemetics Division]]]//.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Wheeler is intentionally not described very specifically in the stories. The only description she receives, as far as I can remember, is in her introduction in //[[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]]//, where we have:[[/span]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]She is turning fifty this year and slowly greying, well on her way out of "petite" towards "little old lady".[[/span]]
[[/div]]

[[span class="o"]]This is because I think her physical appearance is less important to her character than the things she says and does. Also, the Antimemetics Division stories are not very "visual" -- they revolve around entities which are mostly invisible, and the conflicts are more conceptual than physical.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]But this is no use if you want to draw her! So I have recently started to rethink this. Here's a rough outline of what I think Wheeler looks like:[[/span]]

* [[span class="o"]]About 50 years old in most of her appearances (but it depends on the [[[antimemetics-division-timeline|timeframe]]], naturally)[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]About 1.55m (5'1") tall. Petite-ish build (I don't know weights, sorry). Too small to ever be physically imposing, but her stance/posture is usually at least authoritative[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Masses of long, very dark or black hair, wavy, ending just past the shoulder. Streaked with grey. She doesn't dye it. Normally this is pinned up or tied back[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Greyish/brownish eyes[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Default facial expression is neutral shading to irritable. She is difficult to cheer up[[/span]]

++ [[span class="o"]]Attire[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Wheeler is typically dressed for administrative and managerial tasks at Site 41, which is a "Safe" Foundation facility, meaning that the general level of preparedness required among staff is relatively low. As Antimemetics Division chief, she dresses for authority. Think CEO, not schoolmarm. She consciously tries to avoid looking like either Dana Scully from //The X-Files// (she hates that show) or like a man in black //i.e.// "Elle" (Linda Fiorentino) at the end of //Men In Black//. She is not a researcher and is unlikely to be seen wearing a lab coat.[[/span]]

* [[span class="o"]]Fashionable, squarish glasses with thick, bright blue frames. These are varifocals[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Dark business suit. Trousers (she dislikes skirts, no mobility). **Pockets**. Short jacket, interesting cut. She often takes the jacket off[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Neutrally coloured blouse with an interesting design. Definitely not a simple button-up office shirt, **definitely not a necktie**[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Good quality ankle boots with stubby heels[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Prior to the events of //[[[where-have-you-been-all-my-life|Where Have You Been All My Life]]]//, she wears a wedding ring. Afterwards, she doesn't[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Other than this, no jewellery (earrings, necklace, bracelets)[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Sturdy mechanical wristwatch. Functional, not flashy/stylish. This is not a piece of jewellery, it's a piece of equipment. It's unlikely to be gold or silver[[/span]]
* [[span class="o"]]Always wears a Foundation photo ID/access card when at work, on a lanyard around her neck. The lanyard is brightly coloured and contrasts with the rest of her neutrally-coloured look; the ID card is chunky and also brightly-coloured, indicating her seniority //e.g.// maybe red and orange diagonal stripes along one side? There's an opportunity to be fairly creative here[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]In summary, Wheeler is generally a small, fairly monochromatic-looking lady with a sour attitude and a few bright points of colour about her person.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Of course I have no idea whether this description matches up with your mental image of her, if you had one! She can look however you like...[[/span]]

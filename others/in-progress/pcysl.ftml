You are Human.

**Ethics** is a word referring to the principles of human right conducts,

The Foundation-ists and the GOC are at war with each other in the most normal way. The vitrification anomaly does not seem to have crossed the ocean.
**Who:** Recently, I hardly feel hunger, fatigue, or sleepiness anymore, and I have been becoming trans-human.
**Addendum:** I was interrogated by The GOC personnel and explained my situation. They didn't know the word 'Ethics'. During the interrogation, they were blacked out and turned into masses of unidentifiable black material.
At the same time, I lost the meaning of the word 'GOC'. It was very similar to the situation where I lost and recalled the meaning of 'Portal' while I was unaware.
↑
It is believed that if a person loses their underlying concept(faith, name, etc.), they ceases to exist as a human being.
I suppose that I was also blacked out when the concept of 'Ethics' was lost.

And I have a hunch, which is so certain that it could be called a certainty, that this is where I, as a human being, will end up.
I am sure that one more step north and I will cross the line into the post-human, and I will no longer be hungry or sleepy.

@@ @@

The difference between human, trans-human, and post-human is explained as a difference in sensitivity.
In essophysics, knowledge and concepts are compared to stars in the night sky. Following this metaphor, ordinary/trans/post-humans are represented as human beings standing on the earth.
* Completely Ordinary Humans: Stand at the South Pole
* Trans-/Anomalous Humans: Stand in the Southern Hemisphere
* Post-Humans: Stand in the Northern Hemisphere

There are no stars that are the same in the starry sky seen by extreme post-humans standing at the North Pole as in the starry sky seen by completely ordinary humans standing at the South Pole.
In both the northern and southern hemispheres, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, but it moves in the opposite direction.
Constellations also appear to be upside down. Trans-humans and post-humans see the same things very differently.
It is hard to say that post-humans and ordinary humans see the same starry sky in the first place.

I, whose anomaly is gradually augmenting, rapidly approached the northern hemisphere(post-human) from the South Pole(ordinary human).

The above quote were left by an essophysicist before the Foundation became trans-humanized, which is the very reason why I did not stop walking.

The Foundation, which consists of only post-humans, has been trying to contain the entire universe forever against the unprecedented massive containment breach.

While I am dedicated to the three directives('Secure', 'Contain', 'Protect') of the Foundation, however, I must resist the Foundation based on the Ethics that the Foundation has annihilated.

I will avoid mentioning the specific nature of SCP-3125-JP as this memo will be read in the event of failure, but I think it is very ethical towards human beings.

[[span class="o"]]Should SCP-4051 breach the outer wall of its containment unit, Dr. Yesenia is to be called upon as the primary catalyst for de-escalating potential conflict and recontaining it. If Dr. Yesenia is unable to de-escalate the breach due to unforeseen complications, on-site containment teams are to use standard Ranged-Incapacitation engagement tactics. Note that if SCP-4051 becomes cognizant of the assault team, the strike is to be aborted and the team immediately redeployed.[[/span]]
万が一SCP-4051が収容ユニットの外壁を破壊したならば、イエセニア博士が衝突可能性を低減させ、再収容するための第1の触媒として招集されます。もしイエセニア博士が予期せぬ障害により収容違反の事態を好転できない場合は、サイト収容チームは標準遠隔無力化戦術を用いねばなりません。もしSCP-4051が強襲チームを認識したならば、攻撃は中止され、チームは即時再配備されなくてはならないことに注意してください。

[[span class="o"]]**Description:** SCP-4051 is a male humanoid which can create temporary Class-E wormholes to extradimensional spaces populated by a theoretically infinite number of a unique item. These items are able to be removed from the extradimensional space, given that they are physically able to fit through the wormhole. Testing has concluded that SCP-4051 is unable to alter the contents of the extradimensional space after manifestation.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-4051は理論上無限個の珍しい物品が存在する異次元空間に繋がる一時的クラス-Eワームホールを作成可能な男性人型実体です。これら物品がワームホールを物理的に通過可能であるならば、異次元空間から取り出せます。SCP-4051は顕現後に異次元空間の内容物を変更できない、と実験により結論付けられています。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-4051 has been able to manifest the following items during controlled experiments overseen by Dr. Edwards at Site-17. Manifested items detailed in the relevant experiment logs below have been omitted.[[/span]]
SCP-4051はサイト-17でのエドワーズ博士の監督下の制御実験にて以下の物品を顕現できました。関連実験記録にて詳述されている顕現された物品は以下から省かれています。

* [[span class="o"]]A small, weighted net, measuring 3 m^^2^^.[[/span]] _
3m²と計測された小さな錘付きネット。
* [[span class="o"]]A standard pharmaceutical container of sugar pills, although the label describes the pills as headache medication.[[/span]] _
糖衣錠の入った標準薬箱。なおラベルに頭痛薬と記されている。
* [[span class="o"]]A glass of drinking water.[[/span]] _
コップ一杯の飲料水。

[[span class="o"]]SCP-4051 has either claimed or has been reported to have manifested the following items outside of experiments sanctioned by Dr. Edwards.[[/span]]
以下の物品をエドワーズ博士の承認を受けた実験の外で顕現したとSCP-4051は主張し、あるいは報告されています。

* [[span class="o"]]An aluminum baseball bat.[[/span]] _
アルミ製野球バット

[[span class="o"]]--SCP-4051 has been allowed to use its anomalous abilities to assist with general repairs at Site-17.-- After retroactive review of all procedures and programs relating to SCP-4051's containment by the Ethics Committee and subsequent evaluation by the Foundation Containment Committee, SCP-4051's presence outside of its containment unit has been demonstrated to be a substantial threat to any and all personnel located at Site-17.[[/span]]
--SCP-4051はサイト-17の一般修繕の補助にその異常能力を使用することを許可されています。-- 倫理委員会によるSCP-4051収容にまつわる全プロトコルとプログラムの遡及審査とそれに続く財団収容委員会の評価の後、収容ユニット外のSCP-4051の存在は、サイト-17にいるあらゆる全ての職員に対する潜在的脅威であると証明されています。

[[span class="o"]]**Recovery:** SCP-4051 was first brought to the attention of Foundation operatives in August of 2012 when a video depicting it using its anomalous abilities began to gain significant online attention. The recording depicted SCP-4051 assaulting and detaining several men via its anomalous abilities.[[/span]]
**回収:** SCP-4051が最初に財団エージェントの注意を引いたのは、2012年8月に異常能力を使用している様を描いた動画がネット上の注目を大いに集め始めた時でした。SCP-4051が強襲して複数人の男性を異常能力を用いて鎮圧している様を録画は描いていました。

[[span class="o"]]The video gained over two million views before warranting an intervention, following multiple testimonies by commenters of similar occurrences. [[[task-forces#pi-1 | Mobile Task Force Pi-1 "City Slickers"]]] identified SCP-4051 and performed a successful retrieval and extraction.[[/span]]
動画は介入許可を得る以前に200万回以上再生され、コメント投稿者からは同様の事案についての複数の証言が寄せられました。[[[task-forces#pi-1|機動部隊パイ-1 "シティ・スリッカーズ"]]]はSCP-4051を同定し、回収と事情聴取[[footnote]]**査読時注:** extractには情報を無理やり抜き出すという意味があるためこのように訳しました。[[/footnote]]に成功しました。

----

[[span class="o"]]**Foreword:** Due to SCP-4051’s resistance during its retrieval, SCP-4051 has been separated from Dr. Roswell by a one-way glass barrier and is handcuffed to a chair.[[/span]]
**前書き:** 回収中にSCP-4051が抵抗したため、SCP-4051とロズウェル博士の間はマジックミラーで隔てられており、SCP-4051は手錠で椅子に繋がれています。

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Kind of. Only small objects, I think. I mostly use it to help people.[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** ある程度だけど。小さなものだけ、だと思う。人助けにほとんどの場合使ってる。

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** You’re referring to your vigilantism?[[/span]]
**ロズウェル博士:** あなたのヴィジランティズム[[footnote]]**査読時注:** ヴィジランテは多分有名[[/footnote]]について言っているのですか？

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah. It used to be carjackings and thefts and stuff, but recently I’ve gotten involved with this group called the Looming Shadow. They’re stealing money for something, so I have to do nightly patrols. I tried contacting the police, but I’m pretty sure they’ve been bought out. Actually, wait, could you guys do anything about it?[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** ああ。前はカージャックとか泥棒とかそういう奴らを相手にしてたんだけれども、最近はルーミン・シャドーって呼ばれるグループを相手してきたんだ。なんかの為に金を盗んでっから、夜にパトロールしなくちゃなんねんだ。警察に伝えようとしたこともあんだけどさ。連中買収されてるってわかるんだわ。実際、待って、あんたら何かそれについて出来る？

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** I’ll send a request. Do you know if anyone has seen you use your anomalous capabilities?[[/span]]
**ロズウェル博士:** リクエストを送りましょう。誰かに異常能力を使用している所を見られたかどうか分かりますか？

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** A few people, yeah. I helped this one woman a while back, and there have probably been a few I don’t know about. I try to keep this stuff quiet.[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** ほんの少しの人には、な。ちょっと前に女の人1人を助けたし、知らない人も多分少しいたんじゃないかな。このことについて目立たないようにはしてるんだ。

**日付:** 2012/08/15

[[span class="o"]]**Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest several items by Dr. Roswell: a 3 cm^^3^^ cube of lead, an object of SCP-4051's choice, and a container of bleach.[[/span]]
**手順:** SCP-4051は複数の物品を顕現するようロズウェル博士に求められます。それらは3cm³の鉛の立方体、SCP-4051の選択した物、そして漂白剤の入った容器です。

[[span class="o"]]**Results:** SCP-4051 produced the cube after some hesitation. Requests for an object of its choice resulted in SCP-4051 removing a framed picture of its mother. SCP-4051 expressed discomfort at being requested to remove the bleach but complied without incident.[[/span]]
**結果:** SCP-4051は多少躊躇った後に立方体を生成しました。選択物を求められた結果、SCP-4051は額縁入りの母親の写真を取り出しました。SCP-4051は漂白剤を取り出すよう求められた際に不快感を表明しましたが、問題なく従いました。

[[span class="o"]]**Afterword:** SCP-4051 was escorted back to its containment unit and reportedly asked how long it would need to test its anomalous properties. Site staff were informed that they ought to avoid the question if possible, for the continuation of SCP-4051’s compliance.[[/span]]
**後書き:** SCP-4051は収容ユニットに付き添われて戻りました。その間自身の異常性質についてどれほどの期間実験する必要があるのかを質問したと報告されています。SCP-4051のコンプライアンスを継続させるため、サイト職員は可能であれば質問に対してはぐらかすべきであると通達されました。

----

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]**Note:** Seems like it needs to have a clear mental image before it can manifest anything. More testing to determine boundaries of its anomaly will follow.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Procedure:** SCP-4051 is to be asked to manifest a copy of Leo Tolstoy’s //War and Peace// and a functioning mobile phone.[[/span]]
**手順:** SCP-4051はレオ・トルストイの//戦争と平和//及び動作する携帯電話を顕現するよう求められます。

[[span class="o"]]**Results:** The produced copy of Tolstoy's novel displayed the English words "War and Peace" written in large font on a blank cover. Most pages of the book contained redundant gibberish tangentially related to war, and SCP-4051 confessed that it was unfamiliar with the contents of the novel.[[/span]]
**結果:** 産生された1冊のトルストイの小説は無地の表紙に大きなフォントで英語の「War and Peace」と書かれていました。書籍のほとんどのページが戦争に関する冗長で明後日の方向に頓珍漢な内容をしており、SCP-4051は小説の内容をよく知らないと自白しました。

[[span class="o"]]The mobile phone that was manifested appeared to be unremarkable until attempts were made to operate it, and it was revealed to be completely hollow.[[/span]]
顕現された携帯電話は操作してみるまで特に違いは見当たりませんでしたが、操作してみると中身が完全に空洞であると明らかになりました。

[[span class="o"]]**Afterword:** As SCP-4051 was being escorted back to its containment unit, it asked repeatedly how its family was, and if it could have any company as it waited for the next test. All questions were ignored by the escort team.[[/span]]
**後書き:** SCP-4051は収容ユニットに連れ戻される際、その家族の現状及び次の実験を待つ間誰でも良いので話し相手を得られないかと繰り返し尋ねていました。護送チームは全質問を無視しました。

**SCP-4051:** 何時になったら俺は家に帰れるんだ？

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** You may return home when the Foundation determines that it no longer requires your ability for research purposes. After this test, provided no new developments occur, we will begin to investigate how your anomaly functions on a scientific level.[[/span]]
**ロズウェル博士:** あなたの能力をこれ以上研究する必要が無いと財団が判断した時、あなたは帰宅できるかもしれません。この実験の後、仮に何も新しい進展が生じないとすれば、私たちはあなたのアノマリーがどのように機能しているのかを科学的に[[footnote]]**査読時注:** "on a commercial level"は「商業的に」と訳されるためそれに倣いました。[[/footnote]]調査し始めます。

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Are you sure? The men who took me back to my cell weren’t.[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** 本当？部屋に連れ戻す男たちはわからないようだったけれども。

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** I am certain. The experiment will now—[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I'm not doing any more of these experiments until my mother knows what happened to me.[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** 母さんが俺に起きたことを知らない限り、俺はこれ以上実験しないぞ。

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** I can communicate your wishes to my superiors as soon as this test is completed.[[/span]]
**ロズウェル博士:** あなたの希望を上司に伝えられます。この実験が終わり次第すぐにでもね。

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, okay. Good. Do that.[[/span]]
**SCP-4051:** ああ、OK。よし。そうしろよ。

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Roswell:** The requested items are a circular square, the color blue, and a statement that says it’s false.[[/span]]
**ロズウェル博士:** 求められる物品は円形の四角形、青色、そして自身が偽であると言う声明です。

[[span class="o"]]//A look of confusion passes over SCP-4051’s face before it rapidly manifests all three. Detrimental effects on the cognitive abilities of anyone directly observing the objects exhibited themselves immediately. SCP-4051 was immediately incapacitated by attending security personnel and returned to its containment unit.//[[/span]]
//SCP-4051の顔に困惑の表情が浮かび、その後3つ全てを素早く顕現させた。物品を直接観察したあらゆる人の認知能力に対する有害な影響が即座に発揮された。臨席していた警備員によりSCP-4051は即座に無力化され、収容ユニットに連れ戻された。//

**<ログ終了>**

[[span class="o"]]**Afterword:** SCP-4051 was returned to its containment unit and the testing chamber was sanitized of residual paradoxical contamination as per standard paracognitohazard protocol ψ-3.[[/span]]
**後書き:** SCP-4051は収容ユニットに戻され、実験室からは標準超常認識災害プロトコルψ-3に従って残存逆理汚染が除去されました。

----
[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]**Note:** SCP-4051 can manifest non-existent objects, apparently. Due to the effects of this experiment on Dr. Roswell, it is unlikely testing of this nature will continue. Additionally, SCP-4051’s noncompliance may prove to be an issue. I’ll send in a request for a pediatric specialist in a bit. This could be monumental in our understanding of how gateways to other dimensions are formed, and it'd be a shame to have 4051 just be another anomaly we need to keep locked in a box. Just imagine how helpful it would be if we could just use it to patch up the facility. Yeah, I'll send that request now.[[/span]]
**メモ:** SCP-4051は非実在物体を明らかに顕現できる。ロズウェル博士に及んだこの実験の影響のせいでこの性質についての実験を継続できそうにない。それに加えてSCP-4051のノンコンプライアンスも問題になるかもしれない。小児専門家の要望をすぐに送信しておこう。これは別次元に通じるゲートウェイが如何にして形成されるかに関する我々の理解において記念碑的事例となりうる。4051を単なる箱に封じ込め続けねばならないアノマリーになんてしようものなら、それは恥となるだろう。単に施設の修繕に使うだけでもどれほど有用であろうかと考えてみよう。ああ、要望を今すぐ送ろう。

[[span class="o"]]**Foreword:** The following incident report describes SCP-4051's attempt to breach containment, which occurred directly after the events of Experiment-4051-e-3.[[/span]]

----

[[span class="o"]]**16:14 -** SCP-4051 regains consciousness in its containment unit.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:15 -** SCP-4051 curls over onto its side as though in pain, only its back now visible to the surveillance camera in its cell.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:18 -** SCP-4051 begins to make slight movements with its arms.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:20 -** SCP-4051 stands, revealing that it has covered most of its front side in small sheets of kevlar, held together by an extremely adhesive glue. Security personnel are called for assistance at this time but are preoccupied with escorting Dr. Roswell, Dr. Edwards, and accompanying researchers from the contaminated testing chamber.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:21 -** SCP-4051 manifests an incendiary device and a blast-proof sheet made of unidentified material, attaching the device to the door of its containment cell and fixing the sheet over it to contain the blast. Security personnel from another wing are notified and begin moving towards SCP-4051's location.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:22 -** SCP-4051 detonates the device and succeeds in breaching containment. At this time, SCP-4051 also manifests an aluminum baseball bat. SCP-4051 begins moving down the hallway, opposite the direction of the testing chamber.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:25 -** Security personnel make contact with SCP-4051 as it rounds a corner. A fire-fight ensues. The personnel have been advised to use projectile-taser capsules for recontainment, which prove ineffective against SCP-4051's makeshift armor. Personnel are now advised to engage SCP-4051 in close-quarters combat, if possible.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**16:27 -** Two other teams of security personnel converge on SCP-4051's location, and successfully incapacitate it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Site-17 personnel,[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]In light of yesterday's containment breach, SCP-4051 has been moved to an enhanced humanoid containment unit. That being said, we've concluded that it would be beneficial for Site-17 as a whole to work to better understand SCP-4051's capabilities. Multiple options are being discussed, such as using it to assist in standard repairs and maintenance, but certain influential individuals have also proposed using it to produce more valuable materials.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I'd wager that most of you don't have the clearance level to know how we produce our amnestics, but suffice it to say that the procedures range from [[[SCP-3171 |  potentially unethical]]] to [[[SCP-3000 | extremely dangerous]]] and [[[SCP-2419 | costly]]]. The Ethics Committee has taken a particular interest in SCP-4051 and are discussing using it to produce the active #Y-909 agent in amnestics. As such, Dr. Edwards has been given authority as Project Director over all experimentation and research regarding SCP-4051.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]All of this can only be accomplished if SCP-4051 is compliant with Foundation procedure. Anything less than absolute dedication to the Foundation will mean that SCP-4051 is not ready to assist in our directive. To accomplish this, we will begin using standard punishments and rewards to promote good behavior, and scheduled weekly sessions with an on-site therapist, Dr. Yesenia.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]All personnel assigned to directly interact with SCP-4051 have been sent a copy of the updated containment procedures and other relevant materials. Your mistake was not realizing how versatile SCP-4051's anomaly was. Let's not make that mistake again.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, Rainer! Happy to meet you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Oh, hi! Are you doing alright?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm doing well. Most of the time, I'm talking to people who just got back from a mission in the field, so having someone normal to talk with is nice.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Eh, I'm not normal, though. That's why I'm here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Yeah, I guess so. You can make things out of nothing, right?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Kind of. Just small objects, like paper or food.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Or bombs?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, um...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Dude, it's alright. I get it. Containment can be hard on people. It's easier when it's an interdimensional dream witch who wants to eat your brain, but when it comes to containing good people who want to help, things tend to go south, ethically speaking. Can I ask why you wanted to escape?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I mean, I wanted to see my family again.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** There was a note about your mother in your file. I take it you were close?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, but can you keep this off the record?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Record?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, like, can you not tell the guys out there about my family?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Thank you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** You're welcome. So, you and your mother were close?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah. Goddamn, she was a fantastic woman. Sorry, //is// a fantastic woman. Dad left when I was twelve, and we've been supporting each other since.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** And you miss her?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Terribly. I wish... it doesn't matter.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I think it does. Do you want to see her again?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah. The weird thing is that I'm honestly not opposed to living in the Foundation.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** You're not?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Not really. I was actually hoping someone would come along who could help me understand my powers. Being the Foundation's lab rat doesn't bother me all that much, since at least I know I'm helping someone by sharing my ability. I guess I just wish it could be a different kind of arrangement. Am I making any sense?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** That's... well, that's just not the reaction I was expecting.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, I guess. I'm full of surprises, apparently.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//**Note:** This may be easier than I thought at first. Right now, effort should be made to convince SCP-4051 that the Foundation has its best interests at heart. I would like to see some modifications to its containment unit as well. Too much concrete.//[[/span]]

__**実験4051-e-4:**__

[[span class="o"]]**Name:** Dr. Edwards[[/span]]

**日付:** 2012/08/23

[[span class="o"]]**Procedure:** A D-class subject is to be introduced inside the observation chamber with SCP-4051. SCP-4051 will be instructed to manifest a small stone, and the D-class subject will attempt to remove the stone from the portal.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Results:** SCP-4051 appeared intimidated by the D-class subject, Subject D-29543, but did not vocalize any concerns. Dr. Edwards instructed SCP-4051 to comply with the request, and Subject D-29543 was told to touch the edges of the portal before inserting his hand. Subject D-29543 made multiple explicit comments and was reminded of the consequence of unruly behavior. Subject D-29543 reported that the edges of the portal were solid, then retrieved the stone from the wormhole.[[/span]]

----

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]**Note:** Thank God, we're getting somewhere again. It seems like SCP-4051 is only anomalous in that it can manifest the wormhole. Theoretically, if we could replicate the anomaly, we could cut out the middle man of getting it to work with us. Since we already have sufficient data on the wormhole itself, I'll try to determine how it uses its anomaly: brain scans, analyzing nerves in its arm, that kinda thing.[[/span]]

__**実験4051-e-5:**__

[[span class="o"]]**Name:** Dr. Edwards[[/span]]

**日付:** 2012/08/24

[[span class="o"]]**Procedure:** A mechanical arm holding a GPS tracking chip will insert the chip into SCP-4051's portal. SCP-4051 will retrieve the intended object, close the portal, and manifest the same object. Staff will determine if a signal from the tracking chip can be established.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Results:** SCP-4051 complied with all requests and created a wormhole leading to the same framed picture of its mother as manifested in Experient-4051-e-1. The chip was inserted and was observed to hang suspended in space on the other side of the portal. When a signal from the chip was received, SCP-4051 removed the picture and allowed the wormhole to close. The signal was lost at this time. SCP-4051 again produced the portal to manifest the picture, and a signal was reestablished, but the chip was not observed; it was later confirmed to be approximately 9500 km from the wormhole.[[/span]]

----

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]**Note:** Well, not exactly the most interesting results I could have hoped for. I'm not planning on submitting a request for more testing on the subject.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Just a small note, too, but we compared the picture it manifested today to the one it manifested in Experiment-4051-e-1. The more recent one has a few changes. The hairstyle is different and a few moles are missing on her cheeks.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** So, about the experiment you did today...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Oh, yeah, it was great! I think they put a GPS chip inside my portal to see if they could relocate it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Did they?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah, the first time. I closed the portal and reopened it, and the chip was a long way away.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Cool! Is that what you were expecting?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Not really. I tried testing my powers on my own, just to see what I could do. Doing something like that wasn't really feasible, so... I'm excited.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I can tell. Actually, wait, do you have any requests for testing?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I seriously doubt you can tell Dr. Edwards what I want him to do, and he'll follow through.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Hey, I mean, it's unprofessional, but I want you to feel valued.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** It's fine, thank you. Dr. Edwards probably knows better than me anyways.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Procedure:** Dr. Edwards is to initiate Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Results:** [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE]
**結果:** [倫理委員会命令によりデータ削除済][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Afterword:** SCP-4051 requested information regarding Dr. Roswell. The request was immediately denied, as knowledge of Dr. Roswell's condition would most likely affect SCP-4051's pre-existing mental health issues, which have been █████████████████.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I dunno. I really did like cross country. I liked seeing nature, and moving around and being active.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I get that. Are you having trouble staying in your containment unit?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** A little, I guess. It'd be nice to see something green again.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Do you want me to make a request? If I'm pushy, I might be able to get you a treadmill.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Not if it means getting on your boss' bad side! I don't want to cause trouble.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Come on, you're not causing anyone any trouble by asking for some entertainment in your cell.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I know that, but... I mean, am I really helping anyone?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I don't follow?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** The tests they're doing on me. Does it help anyone?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Do you want to help the Foundation, Rainer?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I think we've established I can't break out. Isn't there some way I can at least be useful?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I see no reason why you shouldn't be. I'll file a request to the Site Director.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** A request? For what?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I can try to get them to let you help around the site. Maintenance and stuff like that.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//[SCP-4051 rises from the chair in excitement.]//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** You're serious? You can do that? You're actually going to do that?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Yeah, of course! You're a fantastic young man to speak with, and I'm sure the rest of the site will appreciate having you around.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Oh thank god. Oh my god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is... god, I get to help again. I thought I'd be stuck here and I'd just be useless again, but...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** It's alright! Seriously, it's fine. I'm happy you're happy.[[/span]]

 ||
|| 2012/10/10 || [[span class="o"]]SCP-4051 performs its first routine maintenance session. The session is uneventful.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2012/10/18 || [[span class="o"]]Dr. Yesenia requests information regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. Request is denied due to Dr. Yesenia's inadequate clearance level.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2012/11/02 || [[span class="o"]]Dr. Edwards announces to Site Director Graham that Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN has produced a sufficient amount of data, such that a design for Project 350-JANUS should be proposed.[[/span]] _

 ||
|| 2012/11/21 || [[span class="o"]]Site-17 experiences a site-wide containment breach. By chance, ██ instances of SCP-████-█ make contact with SCP-4051 while it is performing its weekly maintenance. The instances initially overwhelm attending armed personnel but are turned back by SCP-4051 when it manifests "fire", which produces a flame constantly emitting from the open wormhole. SCP-4051 is able to aim the fire at the SCP-████-█ instances and terminate ██ before attending personnel are able to incapacitate it and retreat to a safe location.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2012/11/28 || [[span class="o"]]Dr. Yesenia is ordered to verbally reprimand SCP-4051 for its unauthorized manifestation of an object during the containment breach the previous week. Dr. Yesenia complies, and SCP-4051 is not allowed to participate in any maintenance sessions for two months.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2013/02/07 || [[span class="o"]]SCP-4051 celebrates its first birthday in Foundation custody. Dr. Yesenia's original gift proposal of a treadmill, to be placed inside SCP-4051's cell for its entertainment, is rejected by Dr. Edwards.

|| 2013/03/03 || [[span class="o"]]A prototype of Project 350-JANUS is constructed. Testing confirms that the device is non-operational. Dr. Edwards is informed of the need for more data regarding SCP-4051's anomaly.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2013/03/04 || [[span class="o"]]Dr. Edwards requests a replacement of the incision tool used in Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN, which had become extensively damaged by unknown means.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2013/04/10 || [[span class="o"]]Project 350-JANUS continues to produce ████████████ instead of the requested object. Dr. Edwards is given full control over the project to ensure its success.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2013/04/12 || [[span class="o"]]Dr. Yesenia requests a review by the Ethics Committee regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. The request is denied.[[/span]] _
 ||
|| 2013/04/27 || [[span class="o"]]During a standard weekly maintenance session, SCP-4051 is hurt by a falling lead beam. Attending personnel request medical attention, and SCP-4051 asks permission to manifest various bandages for its wound. The request is granted.[[/span]] _

[[span class="o"]]**From:** Dr. Yesenia, assigned to [[[SCP-4051]]] as an onsite therapist.[[/span]]

----

[[span class="o"]]Graham,[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]It's been some time since I've received a formal update from you regarding SCP-4051. Despite my best efforts to acquire anything of substance related to the work Dr. Edwards is doing on him, all my attempts have led to failure.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I am not asking for a higher clearance level. I am attempting to provide you with some advice. I have my suspicions about the nature of Project 350-JANUS, and what you're trying to accomplish, but whatever it is, it's evidently important to your superiors. Due to the time it has taken to develop the project, I can only imagine that you're receiving significant push-back from them. Although I cannot help with the development of the project, I have a proposal for you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]SCP-4051 has a remarkable desire to help. His aid in site maintenance has doubtlessly alleviated some of your financial concerns, and he has proven to be resourceful, as well as capable and eager to help the Foundation.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]If you want to get your superiors off your back, I'd recommend showing them these traits. Explain Rainer to them in a way they'll understand: prove he is a valuable asset to Site-17 by having him engage in the recovery of a low-threat anomaly. Rainer's ability grants him a versatility that humans do not possess. If you throw him underwater, he can create a breathing apparatus at will. If a member of his team is wounded, he can provide immediate medical support.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I want to be clear here. As someone with a connection with him, I have a certain bias. I want him to be freer, happier. But consider the idea that allowing him to support the Foundation in a more active role will be advantageous to you, the Foundation at large, and the people giving Dr. Edwards the money he needs to continue his experimentation.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Good over here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Affirmative.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team enters the structure via a back door into an unfurnished concrete room.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Command, we have some graffiti on the walls here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Noted. Filters aren't catching any memetics, so you should be fine.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** There are some thaumaturgical symbols here. Looks like variations on... well, they should be misdirecting and hiding something.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** So there could be something in the room we can't see?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command, are you guys catching anything like that?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Negative, Morgan.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Okay, then the symbols are probably meant for people passing by the building on the street. They're not hiding it from view, more... making it unremarkable.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Command, this room is clear. Entering the next one.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Understood.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team enters the adjacent room. The room has more garbage on the floor than the last.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Morgan, anything different with the graffiti here?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Not that I can see. More runes to misdirect the unsuspecting.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team searches the items on the floor for two minutes.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** This room seems clear. Our anomaly should be on another floor.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Hey, I read the file report, but what exactly are we supposed to be looking for?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** The reports we got suggest that this place has some extradimensional abnormality. We'll be getting close when the symbols on the walls start changing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Alright team, moving out now. Morgan, let us know if you see anything.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team enters a stairwell and begins traveling downwards. Morgan pauses.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** New symbols. That one up ahead has a serif that imbues it with the power to harm.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Meaning?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** The people who were using this building didn't want the uninvited to enter, so they set up defensive mechanisms on the walls to discourage non-magic users. Let's see, there should be some prerequisite... right, that one up ahead means "Potential".[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** That's what the Hand calls magical capability, right?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Yeah, although... did they give you the same pre-mission materials as us?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I think so. They gave me an amnestic and told me that after two hours I wouldn't remember anything I'd read.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, how do we proceed?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Go ahead and blow out the sections of wall with the runes. They were probably just trying to keep homeless people and teenagers out of here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team enters the first sublevel. The room they enter has less graffiti on the walls, although more thaumaturgical symbols are present.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, what are we looking at?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** A bunch of enhancement runes. One of those makes materials harder to break, another boosts perception, another makes you move faster. Anyone feeling those effects?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** Negative.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Not me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Nope.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** No.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Not that I can feel.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** The serifs over the runes seem to mean it's targeting a specific entity or type of entity.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Did the reports say anything about this place besides the symbols visible from the outside and the homeless guy talking about going to the other dimension?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** No, they didn't. Command, did you read anything with a thermal scan of the building?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Negative.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Is the kid staying with me?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** He's coming with us. Graham probably wants us to test how he does under pressure.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Jayla remains in the room while the rest of the team clears the remaining rooms on the floor. Extraneous ten minutes of dialogue removed from transcript. P-7 Rico enters the final room, which has a frameless mirror leaning against the back wall.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** Hey, got something here, boss.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Command, Rico has found a mirror that seems mostly intact.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** You have permission to engage and determine if it's anomalous.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Understood.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Charlie presses a hand against the glass. His reflection is seen to stare directly at him, while P-7 Charlie is directly observing the surface he is touching.

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Understood.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Team regroups and enters the staircase. Sounds of an unknown entity shuffling on the second sublevel are heard from the staircase. Team halts.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Proceed.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Everyone, weapons ready. Rainer, get in the back.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Charlie enters the second sublevel from the stairwell and performs a visual scan of the room. No entity is confirmed, although detection is made difficult due to the darkness. The walls and floor are free of graffiti and litter.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Charlie signals for the rest of the team to proceed and activate their shoulder-mounted lights. The team approaches the only doorway, and a loud screech is heard before a creature travels extremely quickly past the doorway from the adjacent hallway. The creature is approximately one meter in height, two meters in length, and resembles an arachnid. The head of the creature is ostensibly a hairless humanoid, disregarding the lack of discernible eyes or comparable organs.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The team retreats to the entrance of the stairwell.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Morgan, what’s the likelihood that the runes upstairs apply to that thing?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Very high. Its speed, perception, and durability have been augmented.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Define “durability”.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Physical force won’t do much damage to it. That means bullets are essentially useless.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Hell yeah.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Command, did the report say that this floor is just this room, a hallway, and a large central room?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** That should be the case.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Our goal is to get into that central room. There should be an entrance in the hallway, so we need a way to clear out the spiders. Trevor, you want to help with that?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** You know I do.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The team enters the hallway, with P-7 Rico observing the south end of the hallway for hostile entities while P-7 Charlie observes the north end. Turns to the east are visible in both directions at the ends of the hallway. The team proceeds to the north for approximately five meters before P-7 Rico sights an entity turning from the eastern hall and proceeding towards them.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** Trevor, we got one in my direction, coming in fast![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Trevor turns towards the entity and uses his supplied flamethrower. The entity is engulfed in flame and emits a loud shriek before the flames abate, revealing its charred corpse. Several shrieks are also heard from elsewhere in the building along with rapid shuffling, converging on the team’s location.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Shit, Trevor, cover that end, we’ll slow ours down with bullets.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Rainer, use your flamethrower and cover us on this end while we move down the hallway.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Understood.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The team moves north and is met with resistance by the entities. Three approach from the south towards P-7 Trevor and are promptly dispatched. Two approach from the north, and are incapacitated by P-7 Rainer after P-7 Charlie, P-7 Jayla, and S-3 Morgan deter the entities with conventional firearms.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The team turns at the corner and dispatch five more entities before coming to an entrance to the central room. The walls of the room are covered in thaumaturgical symbols, and a large circular pattern of an unidentified red liquid is present on the floor.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Shit, did we kill them all? I was just starting to have some fun.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Trevor, quiet.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Charlie’s shoulder-mounted light illuminates a child huddled in the corner of the room. It appears to be female and clothed in a thin, white dress.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Shit...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Command, did the report mention anything about cult activity in this building?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Negative.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** May I approach?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Go ahead.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Jayla switches off her shoulder-mounted light and approaches the child, lowering herself to be eye-to-eye with it. The child appears to have various injuries and cuts on its arms and legs.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Hey, you alright?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The child does not respond, but raises its head to look at P-7 Jayla.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Do you know how you got here?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Child:** I was in a library.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Oh? Where?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Child:** [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | A far-away place, and yet, so close.]]][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Um...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** Charlie, just a reminder that this is definitely some demon shit.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Child:** I was cast out. Kept a prisoner from knowledge. Left to lurk in the darkened places beneath those holy shelves.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The child begins to stand but is stopped by P-7 Jayla when she aims her firearm at the child’s forehead.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** I wouldn’t do that if I were you, sweetie.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Child:** You cannot harm me more than they did. Even if your bullets could pierce me, it would be nothing compared to the agony I felt underneath the stone.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Charlie:** Jayla, take the shot.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Jayla fires a single round at the child’s forehead. It stumbles back before emitting a screech, and its body begins to be disfigured as it transforms into an arachnid, similar to the entities encountered previously. Its new form measures roughly five meters in length and height. P-7 Jayla is consequentially knocked back and pinned beneath it as it writhes on the ground.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Shit, get it off me![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The team engages with the entity for roughly ten seconds as it regains its balance. Bullets have little effect, and the flames produced by P-7 Trevor and P-7 Rainer appear to cause pain, but do not deter the entity. It lifts itself up and uses its mouth to grab hold of P-7 Jayla’s right leg, breaking it in the process. It drags P-7 Jayla to the center of the circular pattern and begins to mutilate her legs, causing P-7 Jayla to lose consciousness. At this time, the thaumaturgical symbols present on the walls are seen to glow softly, and the floor contained by the circular pattern begins to dematerialize. After five seconds, the floor becomes a portal into an unknown location, with dirty brick walls and floor of a tunnel visible. P-7 Jayla and the entity fall through the portal.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Shit! Jayla![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** We’ve got company![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Twenty smaller arachnid entities emerge from the hallway behind the team. Despite P-7 Trevor’s usage of his flamethrower and S-3 Morgan’s usage of their thaumaturgical ability, incapacitating ten of the twenty arachnids, the team is overwhelmed. S-3 Morgan, P-7 Trevor, P-7 Charlie, and P-7 Rico are dragged by five of the entities into the portal, and P-7 Rainer successfully terminates the remaining five with his makeshift flamethrower.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(At this time, SiteCommand's connection with the rest of the team is intermittently lost and reestablished.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Rainer, can you hear me?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I can. Shit, what the hell?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** How were you able to terminate the remaining entities without aid?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I, um... I memorized the symbols that we saw upstairs. And then I manifested a few strips of tape with the symbols inscribed on them and put them on my suit. So... speed, perception, misdirection... what was the other one?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Rainer, is the portal still open?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Yeah, it is. I'm seeing a brick tunnel. It's real dark down there.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Abort the mission. Return to the back door of the building immediately and wait for retrieval.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Do I... do I have to?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Yes, you have to. Failure to comply will result in--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Um, listen, I'm going in. That's what a hero does, right? He disobeys his superiors to save the day?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Disobedience will almost certainly mean that you'll never be selected for another mission.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I know, but... they can't have gone far. At the very least, I can try to explore that other place for you guys.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(SiteCommand's connection with P-7 Rainer is lost as he enters the portal. A support team composed of additional members from MTF Psi-7 is requested for retrieval. Connection is reestablished after thirty seconds.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer is seen running down the brick tunnel, using his shoulder-mounted light to illuminate the area in front of him.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Connection reestablished. Rainer, where are you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** One of them is up ahead. I can hear it dragging... shit, is that Morgan? Hey![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer's shoulder-mounted light illuminates an Aleph-Order semi-physical entity//[[footnote]] From //Dr. Harkov's Guide to Classifying Semi-Physical Entities, 1998 Anniversary Edition//: "'Aleph-Order' is a designation given to an entity which is both non-physical and capable of interacting with the physical world. Aleph-Order entities differ from Hazma-Order entities in their ability to deconstruct physical objects, while Hazma-Order entities can only exert simple 'pushing and pulling' forces.[[/footnote]] //lifting S-3 Morgan and pushing them against the wall of the tunnel. S-3 Morgan's body appears to be merging with the brick structure of the wall, causing them extreme pain, but they are unable to vocalize it for unknown reasons. Two halves of the corpse of an arachnid entity are present farther down the tunnel.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer removes his provided firearm and fires five rounds at the entity. None of the bullets appear to strike the entity, although three pass through space it occupies. The entity turns its head from S-3 Morgan and approaches P-7 Rainer, leaving S-3 Morgan suspended inside the wall. P-7 Rainer manifests "fire" and aims the flamethrower towards the entity, who does not appear burned but recoils regardless. Its form appears to be disrupted by the light from the flames.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Morgan, close your eyes![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(S-3 Morgan is unable to respond but shuts their eyes, turning their head away from P-7 Rainer. P-7 Rainer manifests another object, creating a bright flash in the tunnel and temporarily disabling video. After the effects of the flash abate, the entity is not observed and is presumed to have either demanifested or been terminated.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Video has been reestablished.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Morgan, can you extricate yourself from the wall?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Fuck no. It's like my arm and the wall are the same thing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(SiteCommand discusses options for S-3 Morgan's retrieval as P-7 Rainer gives medical attention to their other injuries.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Morgan, would you consent to removing the arm entirely?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Over what? Waiting for another team to get here? Fuck that.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Do you want me to do the procedure?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Manifest a "laser" and test it on the arachnid corpse near you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer complies. The manifested portal produces a bright red beam that cleaves the flesh of the arachnid and immediately cauterizes the inflicted wound.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Right, um, this should be quick. Do you want something to--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Go ahead and do it. I'll be fine.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer again manifests a laser and successfully detaches S-3 Morgan's arm from their shoulder. The shoulder is cauterized, and S-3 Morgan expresses extreme pain.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Rainer, manifest painkillers. The variety referenced in your pre-mission materials, preferably.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer complies and administers the painkillers to S-3 Morgan. S-3 Morgan vocalizes extreme discomfort and pain for another sixty seconds.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Jesus... okay, it's better now.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Do you have any other injuries?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Honestly? After that, I don't think anything's going to feel painful again.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Alright. Do you want to leave and re-enter the building through the portal, or continue down the tunnel?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command, are you sending in a rescue team?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** The team has been assembled and is currently en route to the building. It would cut down on potential complications if you would--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Great. Tell them Rainer and I are going further into the tunnel, after the rest of our team.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Do you have any particular justification for this egregious breach of protocol?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Eh... yeah. I'd prefer to keep it to myself, though.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** I'll put your preference down on record, but I doubt that will be sufficient enough for anyone reviewing your behavior post-mission.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Listen, I'm ex-Hand. I wasn't particularly knowledgable about the Wanderers' Library when I was active, but I knew some stuff. The Foundation is currently barred from accessing the Library, which is pretty standard procedure for undesirable groups. That spider thing that carried off Charlie and the rest is worse than the Foundation, as far as the Library's concerned.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Can you give me a simple reason for this protocol breach?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Right, sure. That thing is attempting to break back into the Library, and I need to stop it. Put it under, uh... "Protection of noncombatants."[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Noted.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Alright kid, you ever fucked with magic before?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I haven't. Can you walk?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Give me a hand and we'll see.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer assists S-3 Morgan in standing.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command, uh... right, adrenaline is coming down.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer begins to support S-3 Morgan as they walk down the tunnel.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** There's a fork up ahead. I saw the spiders take the rest of the team to the right.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Understood. Are you feeling any better?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** I am. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Just, if it gets painful, think about the opposite of the pain.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** The opposite?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** It helps more than just thinking about the pain being gone. Think of it more like pain's inverse, I guess. That doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Both are silent for several seconds.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Did you receive that scar during the fight?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** The one on my arm?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Yes. I saw it before you manifested the light to kill the thing attacking me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** No, I got this before.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** I think I can fix that with my thaumaturgy. Err... I //could// have fixed it. I guess being a Type Blue with one arm is going to be difficult.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** What's it like, being a magician?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Great, at first. You feel like you're on top of the world. Then someone finds out. You ask them to keep it quiet, but of course they don't. You go to the Library because where else can you go?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Was it lonely in the Library?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Alone and without a book to read, yes. It's dreadful. You can see others around you, imbibing a universe of knowledge, being happy and free among the shelves, but you're trapped with your own self-doubt. It's like coming out as nonbinary all over... hold on.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Both stay still as they observe the fork in the tunnel. Two entities are present to the right turn. One appears to be a floating, tattered cloak, obscuring the wearer from view. The other's form is unobservable, due to several localized reality distortions surrounding it, but appears to be somewhat humanoid. The two entities are engaging in hostilities with one another.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** We'll have to pass these two if we want to follow the team. I recognize the Shroud from the Library, before it was banished. It has a particular distaste for the written word and seeks to absorb literature into the oblivion beneath its fabric.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** And the other?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** I can't be certain. I've read about it in the Library, but... well, I haven't entered the Library for a long time. I believe it's an entity that... "rewrites" reality. Both presented a high-level threat to the knowledge contained by the Library and were subsequently sent here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Any advice for combat?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Physical force won't be particularly effective. I'd recommend letting me use my thaumaturgy, but I'll be a bit slower with my blue-spells than usual. We either have... what are those things on your suit?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Strips of duct tape. I manifested them so that the runes we saw on the upper floors were inscribed into them.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** ...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Is that bad?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** It's... inventive. Our goal should be to pass them without being noticed. Unfortunately, that means waiting until they start to fight. Command, how soon until that second team reaches the building?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Approximately five minutes.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Understood. You ready, Rainer?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I am.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The two observe as the entities circle each other until the shrouded figure reaches to open its robe. Several isolated spacial distortions form around the shrouded figure but are abruptly nullified when it removes the front section of cloth. The second entity reacts aggressively to this, appearing to phase from the visible light spectrum before several thaumaturgical symbols are observed on the fabric of the cloaked figure. The symbols glow red, and the shrouded figure acts agitated and removes the robe entirely, discarding it. The discarded shroud is surrounded in an explosion, destroying a section of the wall close to S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Alright, sprint as quickly as you can.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer assists S-3 Morgan as they run through the tunnel. As they pass the entities, both take notice of them but appear unwilling to pursue. P-7 Rainer and S-3 Morgan run for three more seconds before a shriek is heard, presumably emanating from the previously cloaked figure.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** The Shroud is about to absorb us.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** It's about to what?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(A loud sound echoes through the tunnel as an unseen force is seen pulling S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer towards the two entities as S-3 Morgan attempts to use their thaumaturgical ability to cancel the effect. Both are pulled backward along the tunnel floor, and the previously cloaked entity is observed. It appears to be a mass of corporeal, black tendrils.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Morgan! The fuck do we do?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Hold on to my arm if you can.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Shit! Shit![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(S-3 Morgan is unable to resist the unseen force due to their previously sustained injuries, and is pulled rapidly towards the entity. P-7 Rainer reacts by letting go of his hold on the brick floor and manifesting a portal while in mid-air. The manifested object is inconsistent in form but appears to be a series of white tendrils, shifting in and out of the visible spectrum. The manifested object approaches the entity at a faster rate than either S-3 Morgan or P-7 Rainer, and upon making contact with the entity, disappears. The hostile entity, likewise, cannot be located. S-3 Morgan falls to the ground, otherwise unharmed. Both are silent for several seconds.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Kid, what the hell was that?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I-I panicked. I saw that it was about to get you, and... I thought about how much I didn't want it to be there, and... shit! Look out![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Several localized spatial distortions appear around P-7 Rainer's body, resulting in loss of audio and video connection to SiteCommand. S-3 Morgan's video is likewise affected, but audio indicates that S-3 Morgan dispelled the remaining entity after a few seconds.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Connection has been reestablished.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** I read you, Command. Kid, you alright?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer vocalizes extreme distress and sounds as though he is holding back tears.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Did I kill that guy, Morgan?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** It wasn't human. It was an aberration whose existence was dedicated to the destruction of knowledge.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I manifested... oh god, I manifested the exact opposite of it. In space and matter. It must have canceled out with the real thing, and now they just don't exist.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command, I've changed my mind, and I'm aborting the mission. Knowing Charlie, he's already managed to kill the arachnid.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Denied, Morgan.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** What?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Dr. Edwards is currently viewing the video of this exploration and has made it very clear that the operation should continue.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer visibly flinches at the mention of Dr. Edwards.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** And I'm supposed to listen to some researcher sitting safe and sound in Site-17?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Dr. Edwards is the current Director for the SCP-4051 project, and has been given authority over this operation by Site Director Graham.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(S-3 Morgan silently deliberates for several seconds before turning to P-7 Rainer.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Can you stand?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Yes.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** We're continuing the mission. We shouldn't be too far from the rest of the team. Stay behind me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Understood.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The two continue down the tunnel in silence. After four minutes of walking, both audio devices detect sounds of a struggle echoing from farther down the tunnel.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Kid, uh, you alright?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I'm fine. Are you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Yes. How did you get the scar on your arm?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I don't want to say.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Why's that?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I just don't.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(There is silence for one minute.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I messed it up in a containment breach. They sometimes let me out to help around the site, and an anomaly got out during one of my sessions. Big thing, lots of claws. Scratched my arm before the guards took it out.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Alright. Sorry you had to go through that.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Me too.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Several tremors shake the section of the tunnel.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** We should hurry.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(S-3 Morgan and P-7 Rainer sprint down the tunnel. As they do, the walls of the tunnel begin to undergo spatial manipulation, elongating and contracting repeatedly.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** We have company.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Get behind me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The spatial manipulation intensifies in a particular area of the floor, as the head of a large anomalous entity emerges from the brick. The entity appears to be humanoid and continues to rise until its form occupies the entirety of the tunnel. Its body is roughly twenty meters in height, requiring the walls and ceiling to warp around it. Its skin appears to be pure white, with several unknown runes and designs marked in a black substance along its forearms and chest.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** A hundred chains to bind me, a hundred more before me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Your path so far removed, must you tarry long?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** I come as a preventer of misfortune. The one behind you is shadowed in doubt, a thing I have known well. A granter of wishes, I was, in another life; a slave to others by nature, all come undone when one spoke the fell words, "I wish for the destruction of the Wanderer's Library." In this purgation, I sensed a kindred soul.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Your purgation is not yet complete, your powers still beyond you. You may not prevent our passing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I see no comparison between you and I.[[footnote]] It is currently unknown if SCP-4051 spoke in this manner due to an anomalous compulsive effect. [[/footnote]][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Rainer, be quiet.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** A free man, you see yourself? You who are entangled in bindings, both physical and mental?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I, who am--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** //[Speech is unintelligible due to low volume.]//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Multiple thaumaturgical symbols manifest around P-7 Rainer's head, silencing him. The entity's eyes glow and it leans towards P-7 Rainer, appearing to manipulate the runes with its fingers. The runes glow, and dissipate before reappearing around S-3 Morgan, effectively paralyzing them.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I, who am free, know my own nature.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** You are crippled by doubt. Your mind is a boiling sea of indecision.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** And I am free to make it thus.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** You are wrong. A foreign binding compels your hand.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The entity begins to reach for P-7 Rainer, but is repelled when P-7 Rainer manifests "fire". It retracts its hand and returns to a standing position, the black runes on its skin beginning to glow red.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Unknown Entity:** In my eternal perdition, I seek redemption for a crime not my own. I cannot allow a kinder spirit to suffer as I have.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Reality begins to distort around P-7 Rainer's location, and video connection is lost. S-3 Morgan is released from their magically-induced paralysis and immediately fires at the entity, who has begun to destabilize. The entity is unaffected and disperses its physical form into the localized reality distortion surrounding P-7 Rainer. P-7 Rainer vocalizes acute distress and pain.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I //[unintelligible]// slave. //[unintelligible]// need them. I can't //[unintelligible]//.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(The distorted space appears to fluctuate, and S-3 Morgan retreats to a safe distance.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I will not be your slave as well! //[unintelligible]//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Command, I need advice here![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Working on it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Several tremors shake the tunnel, and P-7 Rainer vocalizes extreme pain. The fluctuations of the distortion increase, and the walls of the tunnel begin to undergo rapid contraction and expansion.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** I need an answer now![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(A circle of unidentifiable runes surrounds the floor around P-7 Rainer, appearing to glow and emit sparks of white lightning, which strike the distorted space from all sides. Sections of the walls close to P-7 Rainer disintegrate, causing unknown damage to the tunnel's structural integrity.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Initiating emergency activation of P-7 Rainer's Type-S "Slow Burn" amnestic in 3, 2, 1.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(At this time, all anomalous phenomena surrounding P-7 Rainer cease, and P-7 Rainer falls to the ground, unconscious.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** How long will he be like this?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SiteCommand:** Acclimation takes roughly--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(Abruptly, P-7 Rainer regains consciousness and immediately stands, apparently only moderately impeded by residual effects of the amnestic, and begins to sprint down the tunnel.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Rainer, wait![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(S-3 Morgan is unable to match P-7 Rainer's pace, and soon falls behind.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Get out of my head, get out of my head![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer manifests an object, and all brick walls within a 30-meter radius of him abruptly disintegrate. A path is revealed, and a large arachnid creature is seen at the end, before disappearing from view.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** I've got you now![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer's pace increases until he enters a large chamber at the end of the path. The chamber is composed entirely of brick and is several stories tall. Inside the chamber, P-7 Rico, P-7 Trevor, and P-7 Charlie are seen engaging the arachnid creature. On the floor, an elaborate design of red liquid has been created, with the body of P-7 Jayla in the center. Letters of various known and unknown languages manifest from the border of the design.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Rainer! What the fuck happened to you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(P-7 Rainer screams as the massive, humanoid entity reforms above the group, standing suspended in the chamber. Its eyes begin to glow as it looks down on all of them.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rainer:** Take this![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Oh! Dr. Yesenia! How are you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** I'm doing well. How about you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I'm doing great! I just got back from a mission.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Oh? Tell me about it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I helped a lot of people. Fought a spider. Saved Jayla and Trevor and Rico. And I found out more about my anomaly![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Oh? You did?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Yeah! I can get rid of things by making their opposite. Walls, enemies, monsters. Maybe when I'm doing maintenance, I can clean out--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Rainer, your maintenance sessions have been indefinitely canceled.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** They've... they've what?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** We can no longer allow you to exit your containment unit, due to the threat you now present to the Foundation at large, and the world.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(SCP-4051 is silent for several seconds, before standing and beginning to pace the room, nodding repeatedly.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** That makes sense. It makes sense. I'm sorry.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** You don't need to be sorry for anything.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Can I still help you?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(There are several seconds of silence.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** You help us just by being here, Rainer.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** I do?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** Yes, you do. But more importantly, you... you need us.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Oh, I know that. I need you. I know that. I... Thank you for caring for me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr. Yesenia:** You're welcome, Rainer. Goodbye for now.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** Goodbye, Dr. Yesenia![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//(SCP-4051 sits in the corner of its room and smiles, and remains there.)//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Edwards,[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]What follows is the unofficial report on the incident involving SCP-4051, the anomalous object placed under your care by Ethics Committee liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]On 18 July 2013, 1500 hours, a joint mobile task force, composed primarily of members of MTF Psi-7 ("Home Improvement"), but also [[[SCP-4051]]] and a single member of MTF Sigma-3 ("Bibliographers"), entered an anomalous location in Chicago, Illinois. During the exploration, the team unintentionally entered an extradimensional space located beneath the Wanderer's Library. All members of the team, except SCP-4051 — who entered voluntarily — were forced into the portal.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]While a secondary retrieval team was being prepped, SCP-4051's Slow Burn amnestic was activated prematurely in an attempt to expel a hostile entity from its mind. Doing this resulted in a near-complete collapse of SCP-4051's mental stability, and it revealed that it now could manifest the "inverse" of any given object that it could adequately "picture", giving it the ability to destroy any matter it can comprehend. It utilized this ability to destroy a large section of the extra-dimensional space, neutralizing the hostile arachnid entity as well as the humanoid entity which had entered its mind. The secondary retrieval team reported a massive crater, roughly 100 meters in diameter, with SCP-4051 at the center. SCP-4051 did not resist being incapacitated.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Below are the official statuses of all operatives involved in the initial exploration effort.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**TL P-7 Charlie:** Alive, currently deployed at another location.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Trevor:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in two weeks.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Rico:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in one week.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**P-7 Jayla:** Killed in action.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**S-3 Morgan:** Hospitalized, expected recovery in three weeks.[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]**SCP-4051:** [[[Recruitment Drive | Contained.]]][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]This incident has resulted in the immediate reclassification of SCP-4051 to Keter, and its current containment cell is being outfitted with preventative measures, should it attempt to breach containment. The Special Containment Procedures need to be updated, as well as all relevant staff briefed on the new situation we're facing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Naturally, the official report on this incident will read differently. In terms of the repercussions of this, I'm expecting an immediate review of all procedures and projects related to SCP-4051 by an Ethics Committee that is no longer willing to turn a blind eye [[[SCP-4415 | for the greater good]]]. I'm sorry, Edwards. I can no longer protect you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I'm sorry about what SCP-4051 did to your brother. Dr. Roswell was one of the finest researchers we had at this site. I know we've all grieved, and found different methods of doing it, you included.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Have a good life, Edwards.[[/span]]

++ [[span class="o"]]Extended Exploration Log 2117[[/span]]
[[span class="o"]]Following their capture by 2085-A, access to SCP-2117 was cut off, as SCP-2117-A-1 instances failed to function. A transmission received by Site-19 indicated that 2085-A was holding Zeta-9 hostage, but would keep one-way communication open so that Z9 could report their findings to the Foundation.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]As of 6/14/2019 , Z9 returned to earth with minimal casualties. Extended Exploration Logs of note are included below.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 is seen in Foundation-issue fatigues, with a laser cutter at her side. She is equipped with an oxygen tank and a mask over their mouth.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** It's been about three and a half days since a goddamn woman with cat ears press-ganged us into finding her sisters. They've disabled the cubes. She says she'll turn them back on once we find them.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Christ, this place is massive.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** How big are we talking?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Using one of those Zip Lifts? It'd take us about two hours to travel the length of the ship.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** So, uh, Z9-1-- that's me-- and -2 are on one team. -3 and Tech-1 are on another -4 and Tech-2 make up the last one. And--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** I'm your voice with an internet connection. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** So, what the fuck happened here? The ship said 90% of the crew was gone.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** More. You know how on //Star Trek//, there are a bunch of civilians on the ship that never go acknowledged whenever the //Enterprise// rams a Borg cube or something?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** How many civilians are we talking?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** At least 400. Refugees, mostly, from universes that didn't want them. A few 'skips' on here, even, that escaped you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** So, we're heading to the Brig?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Like the name suggests, it's where we kept troublemakers. Most of the time it was just a drunk tank. Zip-Lift will take you there.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I fucking hate these things.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Nobody liked them. They were there for about a month before everyone went away.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 and Z9-2 both climb on the Zip-Lift platform, bracing themselves on the guardrails.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** A month? Must've taken a lot of work to install them.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** We didn't install them. They just appeared. A lot of stuff on the ship does that.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The Zip-Lift begins movement at 300km/h.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** That doesn't concern you? That tech just appears?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** It nearly gave me fucking heart attacks. Imagine going to the coffee machine in your room, only to find that, surprise, your coffee machine is now the size of your desk and makes any drink known to man! Hold on, call waiting.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//After two minutes, the Zip-Lift lands in front of the Brig.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Okay. Scanners are being fucked with. Good news is the brig is lead-lined, which reduces interference. There's a life sign in there.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Wouldn't the lead interfere with scanning more?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Don't think about it, or it won't work.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 and Z9-2 look at each other. Z9-1 shrugs. Camera shows them entering the Brig.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The Brig is a structure at least 2km tall, with several walls lined with jail cells in a variety of sizes and configurations, including metal bars, plexiglass barriers, a force field, and what is believed to be a walk-in Scranton Reality Anchor. Over 200 cells are visible.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Turning off gravity now.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The artificial gravity in the Brig is deactivated. Z9-1 activates a micro-thruster and flies to the top of the structure, while Z9-2 starts sweeping the bottom.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** You said Wizard was dead. Isn't Wizard the AI?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** One and the same. We uploaded him, before he died.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I'm sorry.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Sympathy. Is the Foundation in this universe not made up of Anti-Spirals? [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** We got a massive kick in the ass in the 80's. Half a site signed a suicide pact and acted it out. We realized that 'Cold, not Cruel' didn't work for people. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Not saying you're not people. No, wait, that literally... [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** 'ts okay. I've gotten worse.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** The Foundation started treating its employees like people, and that kind of trickled down to you things.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:**  Hold up--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 stops in midair in front of a walk-in Reality Anchor. A humanoid figure is seen inside it, floating in midair.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** We got something. Mitch, get up here.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-2 arrives by Z9-1's side, and both land on the walkway by the cell.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I think we need to shut that off before we open it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Any idea how to shut one of these off, 2085-A?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//No response.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** She's probably talking with one of the other teams.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** No big, we worked with these in training.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Let me pull up the manual.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 brings up the file on their tablet, and begins reading it.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Okay, first you have to disable the Kant counter--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** That... won't be necessary.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** What do you mean?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-2 indicates the control panel. Two buttons, 'On' and 'Off' are visible.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Huh.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-2 depresses the 'off' button. The cage on the front of the walk-in anchor opens. The feet of a humanoid female are seen, and soft groaning is heard from within.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Oh my god. Who do you have there? Who is it? [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 attempts to enter the anchor.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** DON'T! Don't go in. Just- just put the camera in there, and the mic. Your headset. Let me talk to them, they- they could be hurt, or scared, or Jesus Christ get it together.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 removes their headset and pushes it inside, where the microgravity propels it forward. The camera shows a woman with a pair of feline ears and tabby coloration in their hair.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Is she alive? How do I turn on thermals on this thing?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 activates thermal imaging. The individual inside gives off body heat consistent with a living human being.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** She's okay. She must've-- she has a friend who ended up in here alot. Drunk tank, remember? She-- she probably saw something happening, and stuck herself in here. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Wait, she's been in here for almost six months with no water?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Jesus, has it been that long? We're cyborgs, we go into low-power mode if we don't get enough water or oxygen. Okay, uh. Far end of the top catwalk, there's a medical station. First-aid, gurney, saline, everything you need. There might even be rations.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** I'll get it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Bring her back to base. Fuck-- team three's running into shit. Euclid engine failed. Hold on.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-2 brings out a gurney and medical supplies. He frowns suddenly.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** It's at least an hour walk back to base. We can't use a Zip-Lift with her in this condition.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 unloads the female from the anchor onto the gurney, letting out a gasp as they see a large section of their tail missing.// [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Bandage that up. Don't-- don't let A see this.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 attempts to bandage the tail. The individual startles awake, swiping at Z9-1, the force inadvertently pushing her away in the microgravity.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Let me talk to her. Give her that comm link I gave you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-2 offers the comm link to the individual, who places it in their left ear. They calm after several seconds, and then nod.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** ...yeah, you can't hear nodding. Sorry, sis. What happened to my tail?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I'm trying to bandage it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Not like that you're not. Have you never done a tourniquet on a tail?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1's expression is slightly annoyed.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Fair enough. Give me that. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-C takes the bandages from Z9-1, and other medical supplies from Z9-2.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Sis, turn the gravity back on? I don't want to get an embolism from the morphine and antibiotic injectors.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 and Z9-2 are both floating several hundred meters over the floor of the Brig at this point.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Maybe wait until we're on solid flooring?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Yeah, fair point.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1, -2 and 2085-C all propel themselves down to ground level. Gravity is re-activated, and 2085-C resumes administering itself medical treatment.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Okay, the Zip-Lift has a low impact setting. Put me on it, and then put yourselves on another one.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-C pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Why is only Boss talking to me?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1, Z9-4, and Z9-Tech-2 all alight off of a Zip-Lift.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Okay, it's getting better. Not sure if the lifts are slower, or if I'm just becoming masochistic.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** So, day twelve, and we've found all of one sister. Out of four. Last six sectors were dead ends.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** Vented the core yesterday, which let thermal sensors pick up things better. There's at least two heat signatures in there.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** It doesn't feel any cooler.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** We've been told not to question it. We on our own for this?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** A's looking for her sisters. Sick of not being able to find them. Took C with her.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Why are we calling her C? Shouldn't she be B?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** They insisted on it. What part of the ship is this, anyway?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-Tech-2's camera looks upwards. A sign displays the words "Menagerie".//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** Ah.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Well, let's not waste any time. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 attempts to open the doors to the Menagerie using a control panel. They resist, as if stuck; when opening, a fibrous, web-like substance joins the doors together, before splitting apart.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** What the hell is that? You guys have giant spiders on the ship?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Don't think so.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The fibrous substance begins blinking in a pattern consistent with Memetic Lures. Z9-1, Z9-4 and Z9-Tech-2 all drop their equipment and enter the fiber.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. No.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** What?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** Our red-headed step sister is in the menagerie. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1, -4 and -Tech-2's cameras see only fibrous mass. Z9-1's camera is destroyed by a sudden impact, believed to have been delivered by a pipe wrench. Z9-4 and Z9-Tech-2 are caught in seperate snare traps.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//In the shadows, a hand is seen on a guard rail next to an animal cage. Another hand holds a switch; the rest of the figure, except for an eyepatch, is obscured. Z9-1's form is unconscious next to them.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** All right, ya fucks. You're gonna tell me what you did my friends, my sisters, and my ship.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9 is unresponsive until 2085-D flips the switch, and all lights deactivate.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** I've got about two-hundred and ten killer memes programmed into these lights, and another thirty on audio. You start fuckin' talking, or I'm gonna go G.E. Requiem on your asses and reset you to zero over and over.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** Your sisters sent you to get us! [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Fuck you. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D turns the switch on their controller, briefly activating on a memetic stunning agent.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** One year. A whole year where we couldn't see each other, couldn't talk, didn't know if any of us were still //alive//. I saw what fucked up the ship. It ate an entire congregation of Mormons on a goddamn metaphysical level. And you fucks //worship// it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** So, I'm going to ask one more fuckin' time, before I get nasty. Where. Are. My. Sis--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D stops talking suddenly, looking into the middle distance. Stepping into the light briefly, red hair is shown, along with a single red feline ear.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** The chat's working? I-- who's doing this? How do you--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-4 and -Tech-2 look at each other, confused.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** Their eyes aren't... organic. I think they have interfaces on them. Heads-up displays.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Yeah. With chat windows. What the fuck, what the fuck, what the--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D turns on another memetic agent, designed to cause sleep in the viewers.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** I need privacy. Jesus.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Fuck me. Glad you got it back online without me.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//There are several minutes of silence following this. Z9-1 stirs next to 2085-D. Dialog occurs between them, briefly, before 2085-D activates an binaural adrenaline-production meme, causing all Z9 members to wake up.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Get up, ya lazy fucks. The Company's still down two employees, and Boss gave me permission to make all of ya into fuel for the bioreactor if ya don't comply.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** That's not a joke. She's the only one of us who knows how to load the damn thing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** Uh. You're gonna have to cut us down.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** You got knives, and the webs have the tensile strength of a nanotube weave and the give of a marshmallow. Cut yourselves down. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** This is Zeta-9 Agent Meghan Yu. I've... been called to the bridge by the 2085 instances. They want to show me something. Don't know what.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 boards a Zip-Lift.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I've been checking the spedometers. These things have been getting faster, not slower. If anything, I'm just acclimatiiiiiiii---[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1's Zip-Lift proceeds at speeds of over 600km/h, before landing at the Bridge.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** //Fuck me!// Okay, ow. Ergh. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I've noticed that, despite the fact that I'm going at speeds that should make me blind, I don't feel wind on my eyes. Again, I've been told to not question it, which... I don't know why the fuck.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 disembarks from the Zip-Lift and makes her way onto the bridge. A large command console is in the center, with 2085-C attempting to extricate another 2085 instance from it. 2085-A is standing by a console further to the front of the room. Through the windows, a view of Titan and Saturn can be seen.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Holy shit.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Yeah. Pictures don't prepare you. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 approaches the front of the ship, and looks upwards at a protrusion visible from above the viewing area.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Is that a--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-E:** It's my husband![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 startles and turns to face 2085-E. 2085-E is largely identical to the other 2085 instances, with the exception of a silver-blue coloration in their hair, ears and tail. Their arms appear to have merged with the command console.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** She tried to fire it at whatever attacked the ship. Ended up becoming one with it in the process.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-E:** Momoko, I fucking //win//. I've been inside it! The Grand Wave Motion Projection Cannon! It's my husbaaaand![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** She's a bit loopy from the morphine. Normally not this talkative.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** That's where the name of the ship comes from. //Daitaihomaru//, or "The Big Gun". Blew up the moon with it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** You did //what?!?//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** We did a whole Super Sentai thing where we all yelled out the name of the attack at once. It was great. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Okay, but-- why did you blow up the moon?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** I'll show you. Wizard, playback Phase Four.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-A brings up a holographic projection, playing back a battle involving SCP-2117 and an entity tentatively dubbed SCP-2117-Omega. The entity resembles an amorphous configuration of tentacles, and several instances have already expired by the time the recording starts.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** That's an Overseer. Ran the Foundation in our universe.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Yeah, well, our Overseers don't look like that. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Probably why you're... well, you. As far as we can tell, the whole thing with half a site offing itself happened at home, but it got swept under the rug.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Jesus. Do these things eat misery or something?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** I think they feed off of the status quo. That's not what I wanted to show you, though.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-A steps aside from the control console, revealing a plaque. Even with the presence of SCP-2117-1, it is mostly illegible, due to damage to its surface.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Get a good long look at it. [[/span]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]Greetings to you [illegible]. We are certain that you must be as bewildered as we were upon discovering this [illegible]] rightfully so. The universe is a dangerous place, as we are [illegible][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]][illegible] the vessel //Solidarity// only appears in those realities in which an organization exists to preserve normalcy [illegible] As far as we know there is only one //Solidarity//[illegible][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]It appeared to us a long time ago, and was ignored until such time as we faced a great threat from beyond the confines of our solar system. Whether this threat was attracted by the vessel, we cannot be sure, but it was sufficient to preserve [illegible][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]So, then, to you, whoever you are, we, the people of Earth, and the Sixth Echelon [illegible]no matter the distance or gulf of time between us, so long as we seek to preserve our existence we are never truly alone.[[/span]]

The individuals stand in a semicircle behind an image of a planet visually similar to the Earth, with the exception of a large landmass at the north pole and the presence of a series of islands extending westwards from the Straits of Gibraltar.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I can't read some of this, but what I can... it's not English. How...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Meme throughout the ship. I'm speaking Japanese right now, and you just don't notice.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Yeah, no.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** "Only one //Solidarity//". Seems... off.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** It's Jumpy's fault. He's been going into universes with their own //Daitaihomaru// and bringing back bits of them-- or whole ships. We don't know why it's bringing things back, or even how it got other //Daitaihomaru//s. And it changes the ship, too.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** I've been looking over the logs since I woke up. We never set up an automated signal from Wizard, we've never had those cubes before, and our power core didn't have a reboot button. It changed the ship so you could save us.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:**  It seems like it was nice here. Fun, even. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Space Mormons know how to party, yeah. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Maybe Jumpy just... wanted you to have fun? You got roller coasters that go at one-third Mach as a means of transportation, a goddamn anti-grav bounce house, and your theater has movies from about 80 different universes.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-A smiles.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** That's the theory B had. We got lonely? Jumpy brought new people. Things were getting cramped? Bring in new ship parts. B kept on pining for battle armor, typed it into the replicator at least once a week. And after Jumpy vanished for a couple of days last year, it finally--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-A blinks.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** I'm an idiot. Where would a gun fetishist go in a crisis but the armory? There are twenty of them on the ship, all twenty decks down.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** I'll scramble the team.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D crouches by a small door, which reads "Armory 15", working on their PDA. They produce a glass bottle of an unidentified soft drink; the neck of the bottle appears to contain a glass marble.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** None of us trust you. We're not going to tell you our names, not even our fake ones. You don't deserve that.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-4 points their index fingers at 2085-D, one eye shut.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** Sugi ni omae wa 'I'm going to punch you in the fucking face if you do that again!' to iu.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D grabs Z9-4 by the collar of their fatigues and makes a fist.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** I'm going to punch you in the fucking face if you do that again![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D pauses and releases Z9-4.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** So that's how that worked. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D resumes work on their PDA, taking a sip from the bottle.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** How do you know that, anyway?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** Downloaded the audio log about you laughing at the Mormons.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** That's probably the least offensive invasion of privacy anyone's ever given us.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** That log was, what, barely two years after you stole this? It's been almost thirty. You kind of just sound...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Tired? Yeah, I am fuckin' tired. I'm dyin', been angry all my damn life, and there wasn't a time I was on Earth that wasn't spent in the dark or runnin' from the law.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D puts their PDA down and drinks from the bottle for several seconds.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** It's hard to keep up the spirit of adventure and friendship when you've been doing this for thirty years, and you've never gotten to experience Akihabara in a context that wasn't "blowing up underground gene clinics". [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** The rest of them seem to be doing okay.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** They're puttin' on a show. I didn't do that when I was in your cell, I'm not doin' it now. The world sucks, we're dead in seven days, and I'm. Kind of fucking sick of being angry.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-D growls.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** If she's alive in there, I'm going to kill her. She did something to the encryption--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The door to the armory opens. 2085-B-- black and white hair and ears, with a headband around its head-- steps out.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-B:** It wasn't locked, ya dingbat. I was holding it shut-- I wanted to make sure it was actually you.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** You lost the war, by the way. Your little sis fucked the Wave Motion Cannon.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-B:** Eh. 'bout time someone won it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** All right, replicator spat up some of these.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-A offers a set of cubes identical to SCP-2117-A-1 instances, but with different wording on them. Z9-Tech-2 takes a cube.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-Tech-2:** 'Our home is in the //Daitaihomaru//'s berth, but for now, we return to Earth.' Where is this going to take us, though?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Field in outside of Nagano. That's where it first impacted.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** Hear that, guys? Get ready to take us back.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9-1 looks at the assembled 2085 instances.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-1:** So, what are you going to do when... y'know.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-B:** Drink, play games, watch anime. Reminisce on the good old times.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** I'm going to be monitoring all of us, making sure we're comfortable. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-4:** We have gene therapy on Earth. You really don't have to--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-E:** It's not just our genetics that are gonna fail. Our original augmentations are designed to give, too. [[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-E steps forward and offers a USB drive to Z9-1.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-E:** Tutorial on how to run this ship. Includes pass codes to activate the Wave-Motion Gun, how to feed Jumpy, how to use the crew manifest--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-D:** Where the fuck is Jumpy? He get taken, too?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-C:** That's... hmm. The original scan said there were twelve lifeforms on the ship, when you guys were here. Us makes eleven...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//2085-E jumps on SCP-2117-A-4 and begins attempting to induce vomiting.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Z9 and all 2085 instances turn to view the main windows of SCP-2117's bridge, which have turned into a screen. An image of a sickly man in an astronaut's uniform wearing a wizard's hat looks down at those assembled.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-2117-A-2:** I can't see you die, girls. You've barely been off this ship in the last twenty-five years. The Foundation in this universe is still a bunch of bastards who keep people locked up for having wings and deny the world the cure for cancer--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Z9-2:** Hey![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-2117-A-2:** Article 7 of the Black Rabbit Company charter: 'We’re family. No one goes hungry, no one gets left behind.' I left you behind.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**2085-A:** Wiz, you died. That's okay.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-2117-A-2:** You five were the greatest adventure I've ever had. But you've never had any peace-- it's always been running through the stars and through the universes. And death isn't peace-- it's nothing. [[/span]]

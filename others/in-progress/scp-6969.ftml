[[span class="o"]][[span style="color: #fff0f0;"]]**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:**[[/span]] Due to the inherent nature of the anomaly's activation conditions within human biology, SCP-6969 cannot be contained at this time. Efforts are directed towards nullifying the thaumaturgical activation of SCP-6969 on a global scale via application of the Thaumaturgical Interpolator Termination String. Regardless, as SCP-6969's effects are self-censoring and global neutralization would be immensely costly, this is considered a low priority.[[/span]]
[[span style="color: #fff0f0;"]]**特別収容プロトコル:**[[/span]] 人体の生理上アノマリーの活性化条件の本質的性質により、SCP-6969は現時点において収容不可能です。収容努力は奇跡術的補間終了文言を使用しての全世界のSCP-6969の奇跡術的活性化の無効化に向けられます。しかしながら、SCP-6969の効果は自己検閲特性を持ち、全世界的無力化には莫大な費用が掛かることから、収容努力は低優先であると考えられています。

[[span class="o"]][[span style="color: #fff0f0;"]]**DESCRIPTION:**[[/span]] SCP-6969 is the designation for a thaumaturgic biological process which occurs during ejaculation.[[/span]]
[[span style="color: #fff0f0;"]]**説明:**[[/span]] SCP-6969は射精中に発生する奇跡術的生物学的プロセスに対する指定です。

[[span class="o"]]When a human being attempts to discharge — whether during the process of intercourse or, more commonly, not — a series of internal thaumaturgic processes occur within the individual's genitalia, affecting the entire body. Over the duration of approximately two seconds, the affected subject will enter and experience a causal time loop, repeatedly beginning at the moment of ejaculation and lasting a short period of time. No changes to the subject's physiology are preserved between time loops, save for two factors: one, the activity of the nervous system, and two, sperm's genetic composition (where applicable).[[footnote]]Of note, the genetic composition of the sperm ejaculated changes states before and after SCP-6969, suggesting the anomaly modifies it.[[/footnote]][[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Upon conclusion of an unknown number of repetitions, the causal time loop ceases, and a secondary thaumaturgic effect activates. The secondary effect resets the nervous system to the state it was when the time loop began, allowing for the seamless transition between pre- and post-orgasm states by resetting memory. Following this, anomalous activity relating to SCP-6969 ceases.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Research suggests that affected subjects may experience a subjective time of anywhere from sixteen days to roughly seventy-three quintillion years every ejaculation.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**PROCEDURE:** Subjects were previously married and were reported to possess "unresolved sexual tension" in D-Class holding areas. Both were informed of the nature of the experiment and begrudgingly agreed. D-05370 was thaumaturgically modified to retain memories of their experience during SCP-6969. D-908707 was not modified. Both were non-invasively recorded during the process.[[/span]]

[[div clas="blockquote"]]
[[span class="o"]]When I began working on SCP-6969, I initially tackled it with the idea that this was a malicious force I was working against. I think, in one way or another, we all believed that this anomaly was //evil//, or created by something evil to do evil upon us. How many anomalies were the result of eldritch horrors? Surely this must be one of them. But, as I stand here before my research and the evidence piles on my desk, I have to conclude that the theme we're seeing isn't a malicious force — it's a natural one.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]The process of evolution is one which is cobbled together from random happenstance. Genes change at complete random and anything which is potentially beneficial (or at least not harmful) gets passed down, while those which //are// harmful get killed off. It's brutal and messy, but it works — just barely. And, the theory goes, SCP-6969 is the result of just one of those many, many evolutionary happy-little-accidents which may help pass on some genes.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]SCP-6969, as we know, changes the genetic material of the sperm released during ejaculation. From what we can tell, it also prunes a significant amount of unhealthy specimens and increases sperm count in general. All signs point to it having simply evolved over the course of our species' lifespans, creating vastly improved genetic material in a tiny timespan. When SCP-6969 first came into existence, there may have been a significant amount of casualties by people who experienced it without the secondary effects, until one person evolved the ability to reset the nervous system and SCP-6969 simultaneously. Any descendants of theirs not up to par were killed off in the process of natural selection.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]There is, perhaps, one hypothesis of a colleague of mine which I am too afraid to admit may be true. From the complexity of SCP-6969, we can place the approximate period from where it evolved, and it appears as though the time corresponds directly with the development of higher intelligence in human species. As if to make matters worse, the hypothesis goes on to state that without SCP-6969, the genetic makeup of humans may become significantly more unstable, resulting in very high birth defect rates and fatal mutations.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]I cannot fathom a world of such suffering, where we were conceived in such brutal conditions, made to endure such horrors, and die an eventual, meaningless death.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Sex is a joke.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]And we're the punchline.[[/span]]

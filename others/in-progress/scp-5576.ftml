[[span class="o"]]**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5576 is currently housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-228. Special research conducted into SCP-5576 has been authorised and is currently under observation by Overwatch Command.[[/span]]
**特別収容プロトコル:** SCP-5576はサイト-228の現在標準人型収容室に保護されています。SCP-5576に対する特別研究が認可されており、現在監督司令部の観察下にあります。

[[span class="o"]]Further information regarding SCP-5576 is restricted.[[/span]]
SCP-5576に関するさらなる情報は制限されています。

[[span class="o"]]**Description:** SCP-5576 is Jonathan Möller, former director of Site-228. SCP-5576's anomalous properties manifest one minute following its death, wherein all matter located within a roughly three-metre radius experiences a temporal reversion of approximately two minutes. All objects and individuals within this area are affected, including SCP-5576, with the only known exception being its memory.[[/span]]
**説明:** SCP-5576は前サイト-228管理官ジョナサン・メラーです。SCP-5576の異常な性質はその死の1分後に発現し、概ね半径3m以内に存在する全ての物質が約2分間の時間逆行を経験します。SCP-5576を含むこの領域内の全ての物体と人物が影響を受けます。既知の例外的存在はSCP-5576の記憶だけです。

[[span class="o"]]Investigations into the mechanisms of SCP-5576's anomalous properties are ongoing.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Discovery:** SCP-5576's anomalous properties were discovered in 2008, at the age of 96, 11 years after retirement, during a house fire. Based on surveillance footage, it passed away approximately 30 times due to smoke inhalation prior to the firefighters' arrival on the scene.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]Following Foundation intervention, cover story A3549B ("Immolation") was embedded into local news media and amnestics were appropriately administered. SCP-5576's family was supplied with a suitable corpse and the object was detained for questioning and research.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Good afternoon, Jon.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** It's alright, you can call me by my skip ID, Al. I don't really mind.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** It's the first time I'm doing this with a former mate, you know.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Ha. The first ten'll be weird, but you get used to it.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren subtly smiles.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Well, how are you, Jon?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren and SCP-5576 speak in unison.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Just being?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Just being.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Both laugh.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Haha! You remember?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** How could I not? I've only heard it every day![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Oh! I remember ol' Jem started saying it too. What a lad. He still working here?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Oh no, unfortunately. Took an early retirement. Most of the old bunch 'ere miss him too, sometimes.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Oh, what a shame. I don't think I'll forget him. But, on to some better news![[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Oh?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Look at you bud! Got your SR promotion while I was gone, didn't cha'.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Huh? Oh, haha! Thanks, Jon.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I say, it ain't long before you become a director, 'specially since you even worked under me for a while.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Heh. Director, huh... I've never actually thought about that. I don't think I've aspired that far ahead in this career either, knowing it first hand.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Oh trust me, I don't think it'll be long 'till you get to that point. Not everyone becomes one either, so you gotta be proud of yourself, Al. And as a bonus, you're usually far away from the action. And you'll be sitting in the same seat as I did, back in the day. As long as they didn't replace it of course, which, when thinking about it, they probably did.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 exaggeratedly sighs and the two laugh together. Midway through SCP-5576 wheezes.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Well, how old's Nina now? Twelve? Fifteen?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** She's eleven now. They grow up pretty darn fast, Jon.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I bet they do. I remember exactly what she was like, that lovable little rascal.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Oh, she's still that alright. You won't know how much trouble she gets into with Kalli, though I don't always try to get on her side. Somebody's gotta defend the kids now, shouldn't they?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Of course, it's probably ain't nice for the kid, not that I'm an expert when it comes to the topic.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Well... heh, "fifteen?" You still suck when it comes to keeping track of time, now don't you? Deadlines always had a way of creeping up on you, didn't they? I remember I'd usually be the one picking up your slack.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Oh jeez, thinking back, that's at least a decade now, ain't it? I can't thank you enough for every time you've helped me, Al. I was one forgetful ass.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//The two laugh, louder than previously.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** I couldn't just leave you hanging bud, well, at least you're--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren is told to cease their idle conversation and is reminded to continue with the interrogation.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Oh, um, SCP-557--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 interruptingly sighs and holds up its hand, as if to stop Dr Cren from speaking any further.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Let me guess now. They tell you to "cease your pleasantries," or something along those lines? Oh, I bet.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren averts his eyes to look away and stutters.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Let's... uh, let's continue, SCP-5576.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 grins but does not make any remark.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Well, to start off: did you know of your anomalous properties before the incident?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** It's the first time I've died, Al. I-It don't feel nice, but--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 coughs.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** To, ahem, continue, I've never knew about it. I could've been like this since... since I was a lad, honestly.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Hm, we--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** You know, I've been with many anomalies during the time I was here. You could say, these properties may be a result of that, you know.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** You're right, we think so too. They're looking into all the objects you were in contact with during your days—well, years—here currently, and to see if there's any sort of connection between any of 'em acting to give you this ability.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Yes, yes. Standard procedure, eh?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren lightly chuckles at SCP-5576's remark.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Yep, the standard. You think there may be any other reason, though? Other than the one we just talked about.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Tough to say. Let's see... hm. I used to work with a lot of ontokinetic anomalies. Particularly reality-benders.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** You worked with reality benders?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Plenty of 'em, yeah.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** That's... odd.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Something wrong?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** I'm not spotting any on this list.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren hands SCP-5576 the files he was looking through.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** These... these are all the anomalies I've been involved in?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Yep.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Oh... yeah. No one knows, do they?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Hm?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** You know, I don't think I've ever told you this, or anyone else here at '228, but--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** You've worked at Site-17?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** What? How'd--[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** I read your personnel file right before this interview. I was... surprised, to say the least. Couldn't believe it, honestly. So it's real? Did you... really?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 creases its eyes and rubs them.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** What'd you think of me, if I said yes, Albert?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** Well, they're rumours, aren't they? I mean... I wouldn't see you in a different light, just because of that. You're still my mate... a friend.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 has a pained expression and wipes its eyes.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Thanks, Al.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** Most of 'em, [[[he-who-screws-with-reality |they're unlisted]]].[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** They weren't registered? Why?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 does not respond. Dr Cren is silent for a moment.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** But, that means...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 weakly nods and looks down at its feet.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I was sent to '17 during my rookie years. I was an enthusiastic lad back then, you could say I was... determined. I didn't give up. Part of the reason why I tried to help everyone... put there.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** All of 'em who got sent there, I wanted to help 'em all the best I could. Didn't do what everyone else did, couldn't bring myself to it. I was stubborn, for the most part.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** So you tried to help them? Well... of course you would, Jon. Yeah, you were always a nice guy.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 looks down.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I tried my best, Al. I did everything I could, but... but, I gave up.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I stopped caring after seeing it over and over, for years. I... I forgot to...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 looks back up, its lips quivering.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** It haunts me, Albert. At first, I thought I could just push it away. I... before I retired, I got them to make me forget. I didn't want to think about it again, I just wanted to enjoy my time with the family I have left, without being cursed by... by those //faces//... those memories. It was a powerful dose. It worked... it did, but...[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Its smile wavers.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** But, you know, Al... recently, it's all been coming back to me. Just flooding my head with all of it. I guess even they couldn't keep those memories buried forever.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Pauses.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** I've sat in that seat, for thousands -- no, //millions// of times. More times than I could possibly remember. But to sit on this side of the table, it's new. Deep down, you could say I wanted this, Albert. I'm happy.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** But... why, Jon?[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//Dr Cren stutters.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**Dr Cren:** It's... it's alright, I know you never wanted to do any of that. If you'd like, I'm pretty sure the infirmary can give you another dose.[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]//SCP-5576 coughs, smiling slightly.//[[/span]]

[[span class="o"]]**SCP-5576:** No, Al, that's okay. If this is someone cursing me, I accept it. I don't spite them back. And in all honesty, it simply wouldn't be fair for me to live a happy, normal life with [[[site-17-hub |everything I've done]]].[[/span]]

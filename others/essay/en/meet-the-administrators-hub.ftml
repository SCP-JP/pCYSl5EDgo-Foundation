Welcome to the hub for my series of interviews with the administration of the SCP Foundation Wiki!

This series was inspired by //An Interview With "The Administrator"//. The intention of this series is to provide the community with an opportunity to see who the leaders of the site happen to be. Hopefully, a byproduct of this project will be the preservation of a small part of our site's history to reflect on for years to come. Below, my inspiration has been listed with approval alongside my own series.

It is my sincere hope that you will be able to relate to the interviewees and to better understand the vision they have for our site. It has been a blast to work with such wonderful people throughout this process! ~ [[*user WhiteGuard]]

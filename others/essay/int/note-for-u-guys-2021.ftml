This is the day when the old year ends and new year begins. So it seems appropriate for us two admins of ZH to post a note for the members of our site. It is composed of what we see this year and our wishes for the coming future. Those who are mentioned in the following article can guess which of the 2 admins wrote down the specific section for you/him/her/it/them. We are sorry that not every members can have their own sections since some members are relatively silent or are too unfamiliar for both admins. Nonetheless, we also acknowledge them at the bottom of the article to thank their contribution to our website this year (2021). We sincerely invite everyone to join our rewind of the year, hoping to march on to the next year on the basis we've had at this moment.

[[*user SamScript]], Sam, Triad of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/site-zh-44 Site-ZH-44(INT)]. He's been in ZH Branch for almost three years. According to himself, 2021 is a year of production booming compared to previous two years. This year, he [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/SCP-ZH-684 rewrote] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/SCP-ZH-060-J a few articles], submitting a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/surge-s-proposal-1 ZH-001 Proposal], and released a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-620 sequel] to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-310 SCP-ZH-310(INT)], which was his debut in ZH. He also spared no efforts on writing SCPs concerning [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-270 Taiwanese] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-327 Indigenous People], and, in advance, [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-228 started to approach some significant political events in history of Taiwan.] But those who know him well can also tell that he's not always a person of serious topics. Instead, he's good at [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/the-ss-vs-ss playing and fighting with other members] or creating some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-00l notorious] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-352 memes]. He also seemed to fear [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-496 endless] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-058 corridors] as well. Lastly, the GOI-ZH majorly proposed by him: [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/yuanji-hub YuanJi Inc. Hub] was also officially released in this year.

[[*user Dr V Valentine]], Valentine, a member who has been here way long before ZH Wiki was created. He's undoubtedly (one of) the true "Ancient Divine Beasts" of our community. This year, he introduced plenty of artworks from other branches to our website. He also created some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/riariaria2 artworks of our member's OC] and worked on visual designs of several campaigns such as //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/summer-contest-2021 Summer Contest 2021: Archive of Strange Things]//. Besides, he has bravely attempted to [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/lost-hometown submit a artwork to JP Branch], [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/give-it-shape writing a unique creepypasta] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/to-the-doctor released a tale with full Taiwanese Hokkien dialogues]. I personally can feel his special aesthetic standard on literature from his tale //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/snedronningen Snedronningen]// in //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/*http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/%E8%BD%89%E4%B8%96%E8%A8%88%E5%8A%83#pages Project Reincarnation Series]//. About his SCP of year, we can also see that he really hates [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-023 a specific kind of insect].

[[*user vomiter]], vomiter, the real leader of ZH Branch. A diligent, practical person that engages original writing, translating and wikidot engineering. Although many members regard him as a solemn soul, he's actually gentle and humorous if you know him more. He is also the engine that makes our website march on; introducing several canons and settings to our wiki. vomiter excels in tales presented in format of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/thaumatalchemy lectures] or [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/r-sinano-chuo-zhtr-2018-11-19-a222a reports]. His works are renowned for being "very Foundation"; [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-571 Excellent] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-096 metaphoric] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/falling-one-is-gone-and-here-s-vomiter-to-left masterpieces] are not rare to see. Specifically, his creations related to [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-617 political issues] are [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-603 impressive] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/anomalous-item-hk-police-helmet shocking] to read.

[[*user Reverberate_a ]], Reverberate. Her in-community activities were relatively rare this year, primarily due to real-life factors. However, as another admin, she is always good at giving critical suggestions when we got lost in the mist, guiding us like a lighthouse in the hazed night. She has the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/reverberation top-tier standard] of original writing, and has created [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/color-of-sea-black numerous great works] about some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/afterimage renowned EN figures]. Her OC[[footnote]]Translator Note: For those who don't know the term, OC means "original character(s)", usually in-universe avatars of authors.[[/footnote]], Dr. "R" is also [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/she-lives-in-my-heart a celebrity among all ZH characters]. Since her original facility, Site-ZH-81 is beloved by many, her [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/navigation apocalyptic story line], which is about the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-100 on-site AI] destroying a dying world, has been viral up to this date. Her famous work, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-9288-ex SCP-ZH-9288-EX(INT)] also fascinates countless readers from ZH or other SCP branches.

[[*user Viken-K]], Viken, an indispensable staff of ZH Branch. He's a silent contributor who usually works in background and cares all members by giving solutions instantly. He's also the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/image-use-policy License ranger of image use in our website] and did a marvelous work. He also has finished the translation of the whole [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub Antimemetic Hub] within his limited free time in campus life. He also submitted numerous [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/viken-k splendid works]; some of them are really compact and favored by public, such as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-774 Mrs. Alicia(INT)], [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-729 SCP-ZH-729], and[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-446 SCP-ZH-446]. About his tales, Viken has his own fashion to tell stories; both the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/at-that-day-you-still-wish-me-a-good-dream wisdom] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/the-truth-is-usually-invisible confusion] his characters presented are truly amazing to read.

[[*user OnHg]], Mercury. He has joined our crew since early 2021 and has devoted so much to our community. Some details should be kept obscure, but we indeed witnessed his loyalty. I'd like to informally compliment him in this occasion: You really did a great job, Merc. Mercury also wrote [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/minamata-disease several] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/resign-in-navigation tales] about his OC: "Researcher Hg", along with his //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/the-plan-of-execution Private Execution]// Series and a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-833 SCP entry] this year. One can feel that he's somehow hesitant on further developing this character, but I think it would be fine to enjoy a pack of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-185 Guai-Guai][[footnote]]Translator Note: a kind of crackers from Taiwan, which is superstitiously used as "a luck anchor" in hospital and factories. This SCP is about the widely known urban legend.[[/footnote]] during break times. You know, calories can sometimes relieve your stress and comfort your soul a bit.

[[*user Mang Gwan]], Mang, an important helper of website operation. Despite some language barriers, he's a active member that brings joy and naughty times to the chatroom. Mang is always active and passionate to help resolving others' problems. We are truly grateful that Mang is in our team, if letting aside of some chaotic moments he involved. About his creation, he would bring some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-172 awing innovation] once in a while. We highly look forward to seeing his growth and achievements on our website in the following year.

[[*user Semibreve]], Semibreve, (another) Ancient Divine Beast of ZH. He's the Alpha of military affairs & weaponry in ZH community and obsesses knowledge of warfare that no one can rival. He always takes care of members of website, regardless of being noticed or not. He also spares no efforts on fulfilling his responsibilities, [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-zh#toc2 missions] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/task-forces-zh duties]. He's also the supervisor of facility [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/site-zh-50 Site-ZH-50] and originator of our villain GOI-ZH [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-zh#NSB-8 NSB-8(INT)]. What he excels most is the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/operation-nucleon-bank-minger epic battle tales] that show [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-888 defiance toward the fate]. These tales are infused with tension and struggles of characters, definitely worth a reading.

[[*user Frederica Bernkastel]], Makima (MKM). He has posted a tons of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-6666 massive] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-6500 SUPER MASSIVE] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-3935 translations] and is undoubtedly one Atlas that raises the globe of ZH translation. Also, he proposed a joke canon called "Department of Tactical Phonology" in Discord chat, which hasn't been really written in any articles. But who knows? We may possibly have this canon in the near future. Makima also translated many "Comprehensive Lists" from EN Wiki during the whole 2021. What an achievement. He has formally joined our staff crew since autumn 2021. Let's anticipate more of his great jobs in the following year. 

[[*user Lostwhat]], L.What or LW, one of the key figures of ZH. His works are viewed as [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/cinderella elegant] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-399 ambitious], ranging from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-200 classic tropes(INT)] to [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-399 innovative plots]. He's also willing to [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-110 challenge his own limits], and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/boorklyn-00-the-heaven apply his knowledge of writing] in articles. He's also one of the persons that [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/lostwhat devoted most on OC shaping] in ZH. His [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/boorklyn-00-ref-rain other characters] are also beloved by plenty of readers. Hope to see more of his works being established on the wiki in 2022.

[[*user AbyssDream]], AD or AbyssDream, but it is suggested to call them "AbyssDream" when referring to the author. A key artist of ZH. they[[footnote]]Translator Note: You can consider this pronoun to be a neutral one, or a proper term to describe their //hive mind// identity.[[/footnote]] are skillful at combining their own [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-111 experiences] and creation, and their observations on [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-2005-ex modern issues] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2017-47-zh personal feelings(INT)] are also one-of-the-kind. Apart from these, they're a excellent artist that uses [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/art-for-701 clearest symbols] to express the most saturated emotions. They're also the leader of facility [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/site-zh-12 Site-ZH-12], which is one of the three most popular facilities in the ZH.

[[*user ting129]], Metha, another member that has been in ZH previous to me. Remember on the day I arrived ZH, I asked whether this "Ting" is that "[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmdc8oBXpYofxGC8s3J_aLQ Ting]" (who is a famous YouTuber from Taiwan that introduces SCPs to the public), but it seems to be two different souls. Metha often uses elements of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-079 Japanese culture] or [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/hafune Japanese Taiwan] in amazing ways. The author also submitted //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/taisho150-lovestorybeforedawn In memorial of Mr. Ang Nau]// to the //Taisho-150// Canon of JP Branch. In my opinion, it's a pity that no new works were added to his original canon //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/taiwan-miracle-exposition Taiwan Miracle Exposition]// in this year. Maybe we can wait for some new works to be born in the upcoming 2022.

[[*user kingdom war]], Wing. He became a official staff of ZH in spring 2021 and is responsible for releasing ZH Weekly Newspaper on the Instagram. He's highly [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/wanderers:victory-day passionate] on topics of Taiwanese culture and Japanese Taiwan Era. Despite that he didn't submit too many articles during the year, he was very active to participate in website affairs. Spotlights are to shed on his devotion on GOI-ZH: [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/tsars-hub Tsar's Seer] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/researcher-wing derivative works] of it. We bless him to finish his scheduled canon about White Terror Era of Taiwan in the future.

[[*user Nihilmace]], Nihilmace, a writer of skills. Although his works of year are relatively rare, [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/parawatch-my-hometown-was-a-miracle each] of his works is [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-946 favored by many]. We hope to see him submitting more excellent articles after he finished the project in [*https://forum.gamer.com.tw/Co.php?bsn=04918&sn=233602 another media].

[[*user Chromeblushowo]], Chrome, a member heartful to website affairs. He's the top-tier consultant of economic/financial profession in ZH. He also devoted to combining his expertise with [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/chromeblushowo his works]. Although his [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-162 current works] are not having higher reputation due to the topics and skills of presentation, we can undoubtedly feel his own fashion of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/red-1354 writing] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/pelia-start worldbuilding]. His potential are surely worth expecting.

[[*user k1s10r0db00ne]], Kris/Kislorod/Oxygen, a contributor of all dimensions. They[[footnote]]Translator Note: "gaseious atom has no gender." -- Kislorod, 2022.[[/footnote]] excel in skillful visual arts, writings and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/cck-class-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-scenario translation of high quality]. Their brand new franchise: //[*http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/%E8%BD%89%E4%B8%96%E8%A8%88%E5%8A%83#page Project Reincarnation]// is currently a viral canon of ZH. I highly suggest visiting their [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/k1s10r0d author's page] and check out their countless masterpieces.

[[*user EmptyName723]], EmptyName, moderator of wiki. He's very responsible and finished all missions diligently, deserved appreciation and gratitude. He also translated several epic-class SCPs and tales. Although his works are relatively rare to see, [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/emptyname each of them are impressive to read], especially the amazing [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-112 SCP-ZH-112: Happy Birthday To You]. He may have to be off-duty in SCP community due to the upcoming examination next year, but we still wish him the best to bring more beautiful works in the future.

[[*user Control Z]], CZ, An [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/bangyen artist] that draws attention all the time. He's not only the joymaker of the chatroom, but also an [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/creepy-tunnel extraordinary artist with skills of professional class(INT)]. His works are full of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/ctrlzpencil  sharp and unique outlines], and have gained high reputations from several branches! Apart from visual arts, his performances on SCP writings are also worth noting. He was [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-034 highly active] in our 2021 Summer Contest. Several interesting [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-880 SCP essays] are born within the middle of year as well. Although his artworks are relatively rare compared to previous years, each of them is adorable to enjoy.

[[*user Bales20147]] ([[*user BalesBomb]]), Bales, an active member who works as a writing/typo-picking machine. His [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/bales20147 series] is steadily progressed in the scale of years and is [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bpuHiYhx9HYP2BmK3kAAo8dCJYnpN50lv3iP7Cm3OxY/edit#gid=0 scheduled] to be not only large but also delicate. He has two different accounts due to one wikidot accident. He really likes to create new [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g_OGoLlGhubCeXjX26UJmuOSjof9ogCEXxGaXLheHo/edit#gid=0 characters]; the total number of his original characters have surpassed 100 up to this date. He's also in charge of facility [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations-zh#toc25 Site-ZH-16]; this facility is an important transfer station of cargoes and anomalies, also the primary stage to most, if not all Bales's tales and characters.

[[*user Sigtina]], Tina or Willow. Her most "notorious" identity is the advocate of GOI-ZH [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/goi-bt "Bell Tosser"]; all her works surrounds the topic of Bell Tosser (sometimes even her dialogues in the chatroom are so, too). I personally consider her //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-248 Corrupted] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-248-f004 Wings]// Series was actually an excellent experiment: Stories surrounding a single character seem to be pretty attractive for readers to follow up a canon. However, I also wonder what can this author create if she does something not related to Bell Tossers at all.

[[*user Pao Mian]], his nickname means "Instant Noodle" in Mandarin. A member of impressive translating and writing abilities. We can tell that he has expertised some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-440 advanced settings] of the Foundation, and is good at building his imagination from these settings as well. He's also in favor of crosslinking his works to articles from EN wiki. Some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-280 experiences] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-390 close to his student identity] were also seen in the year. Undoubtedly, he's a member of diversity. Pao Mian also has joined our staff team since this autumn. Let's expect his performance in the future days.

[[*user lpin000031]], aka Postman. Although he's a new blood of this year, the number of his contributions can already rival that of some old members. He started building a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-804 facility of black technology] of [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-648 Taiwan's authoritatian regime] at the first term of the year, but the series still needs more articles to become a solid canon. Apart from this, he has also contributed some [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-basic-guide translation] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/singlelinetrip original articles]; anyone can tell how much he favors [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page Global Occult Coalition] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/year-69-of-unbearable-memories military topics]. He's also the first one to write [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/lte-1903-orange-blaecca GOC GOI format]. It's certain to say he's gonna build his own kingdom by his diligence and perseverance. 

[[*user YONGZUN]], Zun. a member and windbag of community. We can see a series of tales surrounding characters [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/backtohome Ming] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/finger-test-warrior ZUN]. He also submitted [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-077 a SCP of a parallel universe railway] and its [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/888father related tale]. He literally lives in the chatroom and is good at talking rubbish, however, some members can find some treasure or zen from these trashes. 

[[*user Fan Yeh]], Leaf, Triad of Site-ZH-44. Her most famed article is none other than [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-036 SCP-ZH-036: Raccoons of Tea Addiction]; the most beloved/famous one among them is a raccoon named "No.5". This year, she submitted two tales: //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/memory-of-light Memory of Lights]// and //[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/source-of-chaos Those Interns of 2010]//, which are apparently surrounding a specific shop in [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/shopping-arcade ZH Shopping Arcade]. This tea shop hasn't been discussed in SCP format yet. We hope to see it having a seat in SCP-ZH Series in the upcoming year.

[[*user Jimmypong10]], Popcorn. He is a huge fan of GOI-ZH: NSB-8; even his [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/jimmypong10 profile page used the css theme of NSB-8]. He submitted a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/frozencold series] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/nsb8-rl130 of] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/foxhunt tales] [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/crimson-cherry surrounding] a character who is originally belonged to NSB-8 but later joined the Foundation: "Han-Ying". This character has much potential for future development and worth our following up.

[[*user s97169]], Sugoi. A notorious member/character of ZH Branch. Although the community jokes that Sugoi always procrastinates on writing new entries, but even I was surprised to find that he actually wrote 4 articles in the just past year. These are respectively a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/wolf-125 Parawatch entry with slight horror], [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/mild-people a heart-warming tale], a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-0601-j joke SCP] and [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com facility Site-ZH-13]. What is for sure is that Sugoi did make a lot of difference and attempts in the year. We hope to see him submitting more articles of diversity. Also, since Site-ZH-13 is now an official canon, can we finally witness the drafts of "Tesseract" and "Yorozuya" being born in 2022?

[[*user Aindavis_817]], Ain, Triad of Site-ZH-44. She excels in writing tales in format of novella. This year, she submitted [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/nice-to-see-you a Christmas-themed tale of aquaintances' reunion], and a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/one-of-the-secrets tale that expands the worldbuilding of Site-ZH-44]. From the latter one, we can also see that the author has created some novel interpretations from the lol-Foundation-ZH settings of our early days. As for how the OC "Dr. Ain" would "shovel off" the dark history of the facility, let's just wait and look forward to her performance in 2022.

[[*user CNBlack]], Whitelightning --Thundershower--. She successfully submitted a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/maimai-first-time promised tale of interaction between her OC "CNB" and AbyssDream's "Dr. AD"]. Besides, she also lead a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/20210428 gigantic original co-authored project to celebrate one member's birthday]. Great job, Whitelightning. Please give us more surprises in the upcoming brand new year.

[[*user Jetttttt]], jet, --Jet the Jet--. He submitted a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-093 SCP claiming "Art = Explosion"]. To be honest, I find this potential to become a prelude of war among anartists of AWCY. It was a pity that we couldn't learn more about the identity of //"J"// and his background. We can just wish to see some derivative works about this issue in the future. On the other hand, he submitted a tale discussing about [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/what-the-fuck-is-this-pizza how Taiwanese people show "innovation" on foreign delicacies.] I admire his courage to touch such a sensitive topic, which I in person don't dare to touch up to this date.

[[*user LuLu_Lucifelle]], Lulu the hedgehog. She submitted a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/milk-puzzle tale of Site-ZH-12], a [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-037 a SCP of sea turtle(INT)], and a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/site-zh-12-made-with-wood 3D visual artwork]. From her previous works, one can be sure to say she's a talented contributor. We would like to know more development of this normal OC (which are rare to find in Site-ZH-12) in the 2022.

[[*user helloahuman]], generally known as Lettuce in chat. A new blood of this year. He submitted a [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-769 qualified original work] this year, too. I can clearly remember this author brought a draft about a tentacle monster with a big red eye on the date he landed on ZH server. Later, he switched to different ideas and explored different paths of writing. I personally consider it a good thing for newcomers to try different types of formats and materials, but it is also important to learn something in every attempt. If he eventually settles down on his style of writing, maybe a co-authored project would be a good approach for him to start.

[[*user Elsing]], aka IE. He submitted [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-613 SCP-ZH-613: Blood Angel] this year. Compared to his previous work [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-444 SCP-ZH-444: Ghost Messenger], we can see that he's had a more accurate understanding on SCP of classic fashion. We can also expect him to create a brand new flavor out of "cult" articles like [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-912 SCP-ZH-912: See].

[[*user Fourshadow]], Fourshadow, a deep lurker. He submitted the first entry this year: [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-322 SCP-ZH-322: Cup of No Water]. From the content and his [*http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/forum/t-14031018/scp-zh-322#post-4929623 replies] in the forum, we can see an author of notions. The mystery of "SSP" in the article is another thing we can expect to learn in future.

[[*user KaiTenno]], Kai. A new blood of the year. His debut, [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/scp-zh-226 SCP-ZH-226: Winter Maid] has won some reputation. This author seems to know well of how Foundation thinks and treats a humanoid anomaly. A potential author worth future attention.

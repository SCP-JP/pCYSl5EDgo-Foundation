Here is the hub page of the Foundation Semimonthly, an unofficial periodical.

The idea to "create our own semimonthly" came from [[*user Chricton]], who initially define it as "a collection page of recent contents for dummies, probably with a selection of unrecognized old articles, as well as some recommendations". The response came quickly, with many writers willing to participate in the editing of this periodical. Eventually, based on the original three columns - "past classic contents", "new content summary" and "old original article recommendation", the current semimonthly format was determined after several modifications.

Here, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all users who have participated in editing and all readers who have proposed constructive suggestions. Without you, this online periodical, which is much clumsier than a real periodical, would not be the same as it is now. Thank you.

The following is our list of each issue.

+ Editor's Note

[[div class="mz-blockquote"]]

We deeply know that this periodical is not good enough. Maybe the accuracy of the news is not enough, maybe the editors' recommendations are not transparent enough, or maybe the quoted sentences in the new work representation are not beautiful enough... The Semimonthly has come all the way in our worries.

We deeply know that this periodical can be better. In order to make it better, we need your help. As a reader, just as the Q&A at the end of each issue says, you can send all your opinions and suggestions to us in discussion threads and private messages. As a writer, if you have inspirations and ideas, or intend to maintain and operate a new column, feel free to contact us.

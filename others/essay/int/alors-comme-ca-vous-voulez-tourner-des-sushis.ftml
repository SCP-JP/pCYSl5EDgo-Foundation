[[div class="blockquote"]]

I couldn't help but notice that the meatier [[[sushiblade-hub |the hub page]]] becomes by increasing works concerned with Sushiblade, the more difficult it is for beginners to understand Sushiblade.

Some of Sushiblade's works and works concerned with them are translated into English (INT), Korean (KO), Chinese (CN), German (DE), Traditional Chinese (ZH), etc.       
Some of them are even original articles whose language are not Japanese. But I think the number of them is too many to choose what articles to translate and it is very difficult that you understand Sushiblade.

For those who just discover Sushiblade from movies or games or who just hear about the crazy canon in JP, there may be many questions yet. What's sushi? What's Dark Sushi? Sumeshi Brainwashing? What to read? What points are interesting? I'll answer those.

This is a guide for such a "newcomer of Sushiblade".

+ First Sushiblade
What to read at first after you find Sushiblade.
All interested parties of Sushiblade must say that
//"You should read [[[*scp-1134-jp |SCP-1134-JP]]]!"//.
1134-JP is the first article and origin for Sushiblade and it has all the concepts of Sushiblade. Just read it and you will understand other Sushiblade works.

To be more precise, read SCP-1134-JP or you cannot understand the following sentences at all.

+ The world and groups in Sushiblade


* People for Sushiblade
Characters must spin sushi in a story of this canon. As we all know, //Spin// is the rotation of sushi like a spinning top. If a sushi is rotating sushi on a conveyor, it's not Sushiblade. Characters have various feelings, take various actions, and create a story for just spinning sushi.

But, don't forget that spinning sushi is an anomalous skill even in the world of the SCP Foundation. Those who belong to the Foundation are accustomed to anomalies, but it is so serious for the general public to encounter them. Also, even if innocent people see sushi spun justifiably by a sushiblader, they think it is a trick or something.

However, most of sushibladers don't try to hide Sushiblade. Efforts of the Foundation make the general public unaware of Sushiblade as being anomalous. In order to regard Sushiblade as fiction in public, the Foundation broadcasted fictional stories as a cover story: anime, movie, etc.

* What sushi is
The concept of "sushi" in this canon is often a little different, especially one which members of Dark Sushi, which are introduced in the following works, are using. When you eat dishes in a rotation sushi, for example ramen noodle, some sushibladers regard them all as sushi. Also, the "concept of Sushi" invented by Dark Sushi is made even from incorporeal concepts. A range wherein each sushiblader regards as sushi is different, but if they lose a Sushiblade battle, they should have their sushi having been spun.
 
* [[[yamizushi-hub |Dark Sushi]]] (//闇寿司//)
A group of sushi chefs losing pride as a sushi chef and meddling with dark power. Most of them are willing to use any means in order to win Sushiblade battles and appeals to force. Has various technologies related on sushi, not only Sushiblade, but also "sumeshi brainwashing" and "sushi of weakpoints", and is skillful with mind and concept control. Sometimes cooperates with other GoIs, for example technical collaboration with JOICL, while normalcy-preservation agencies are neutral or against.
 
Dark Sushi writes documents called "[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/jp-hub#toc12 Dark Sushi file]" which are written about research on sushi. Almost all of this research is on sushi made or used by Dark Sushi members, while some of them is on sushi used by opponents, instruments to spin sushi, or counters against sushi.

Dark Sushi's head is the man called Yami. Other members hardly are in systematic activities as an organization. Each member is free to act and often competes with each other. People called Dark Lord of the Sushi or the Four Chef of Dark Sushi have been confirmed as executives.

+ Writing Tips!

"Su-Shi-Shi! I'll write a Sushiblade article! Hey Rassyai!"

Wow, he is also fascinated by Sumeshi.

"Finish! My sushiblader "Jet Black" is the strongest! Murder Takao, Yami and etc. with Aconitum=Sushi! Let's post my work."

Wait! It is not easy to leave a Sushiblade article on the wiki. If you just spin sushi in your own way, the result will be deleted. I'll show you tips on how to write a better sushi article.

* **Don't jest!**　You may regard characters in the Sushiblade canon as crazy at a glance. They try to spin sushi, we can understand that. However, they are often very serious and mature men of sushi chef even in Dark Sushi. If they, excepting a character who is likely to do that, suddenly become fools or throw out sushi, sushi readers cannot sympathize with this story. Most sushi are foods so it is difficult for vulgar articles to have a good reputation. In Sushiblade, funny points are often serious rather than comical.

* **Be consistent!**　The Sushiblade canon has many suspicious theories and mysterious technologies. If you use them halfway, the reader will not understand them well and will be less immersed, and the work will not get a good evaluation. Even if it seems strange, try to keep the explanation and theory consistent to satisfy a reader. However, some Sushiblade authors use technology which gets laugh by rushing with fun without enough time to understand them...

* **Write your original story!**　We are no longer surprised at just spinning a sushi, as well as just changing an existing object to sushi too. If you used even so funny materials, your story could not have a good reputation without cooking sushi from them well. Consider that Why you'd like to spin that sushi or that how you write good works with Sushiblade.

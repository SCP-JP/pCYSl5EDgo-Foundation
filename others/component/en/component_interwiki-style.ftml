Styling component for the EN Interwiki, based on the CN Interwiki by 7happy7 and Sekai-s.

Please note that as of 2022-03-15, the new EN interwiki is not yet active on the EN SCP Wiki, so this styling component will not yet work.

Interwiki: https://scpwiki.com/interwiki
Source: https://github.com/scpwiki/interwiki

See also: https://scpwiki.com/how-to-create-a-branch-of-the-scp-foundation

Usage:

On the page that intends to restyle the Interwiki:

 [[include :scp-wiki:component:interwiki-style
| priority=X
| theme=<link to CSS stylesheet>
| css=<URI-encoded CSS>
]]

The `priority` value must be set to a number that is 1 greater than the priority of the theme that this theme is extending.

Examples:
- The base theme of the site (for the SCP Wiki, this is Sigma-9) has a priority of 0.
- A CSS theme designed to be used on pages that are already styled with Sigma-9 (i.e. a theme that extends Sigma-9) would have a priority of 1.
- The Black Market theme extends the Black Highlighter theme, which has a priority of 2; therefore the Black Market theme would have a priority of 3.

The `theme` value is optional, and can be a URL to a CSS stylesheet e.g. a CSS theme.

The `css` value is optional, and can be URI-encoded CSS to apply directly to the Interwiki. To URI-encode CSS, see https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder

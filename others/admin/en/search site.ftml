[[module Redirect destination="https://crom.avn.sh/misc/wikidot-search-shim#scp-wiki/search:crom/"]]

[!--
This redirect exists to allow the search box, a native Wikidot feature, to pass its query to Crom to use its wiki search.

It does this by redirecting to Crom, setting a third-party cookie, and then redirecting back and reading the cookie to determine the search query. Thus, if third-party cookies are disabled, then the search query cannot be passed on.

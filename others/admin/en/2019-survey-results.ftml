Welcome to the official SCP Foundation Wiki 2019 Community Survey results! We'd like to thank everyone for participating. It's always amazing to see just how many people submit responses, and it's wonderful to know how many people enjoy the wiki and the SCP fandom as a whole. This year, we had a total of 11,096 responses, which is 5,640 more responses than last year. As always, this feedback will help us to improve the site and make it a better experience for everyone.

With the state of the world right now, we hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Thank you for being part of the SCP experience, be it as a reader, writer, or fan.

**Note:** Some polled areas may not add up to 100%. This is due to rounding and the fact that some questions are multiple-choice in nature. As well, while some areas are ranked in a range from the highest percentage to the lowest percentage, others are not; this is done to ensure a more intuitive showing of results, depending on the area.

These were the most commonly submitted questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions submitted in the free-response section of the survey. The Staff team has done their best to answer them!

**__Why isn't there a dark mode available for the wiki?__**

There is a dark mode and a browser extension called S-CSS-P available on our [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/usertools Usertools page] that allow you to customize the wiki's color scheme.

**__I'm having issues joining the site. I have applied a few times and I can't get in.__**

Make sure you're following all the instructions about joining the site listed in the join the site page and the guide for newbies. A couple of important instructions often get accidentally brushed over, but if you read them thoroughly then you should have no issues.

**__I'm not getting the account confirmation email when creating a Wikidot account.__**

Make sure you aren't using a hotmail address and your email address doesn't have any numbers in it. There's currently a couple of bugs in Wikidot's registration that causes accounts with these elements to not receive a confirmation email.

**__The Search Bar keeps giving none or inaccurate results. Is there a fix to this?__**

Wikidot's search functionality has some unfortunate issues that we are unable to solve ourselves due to the fact that we do not have access to wikidot's backend. However, most of the issues can be resolved by ticking the option for either searching pages or searching the forum (depending on which type you are looking for).

**__Any updates on the Russian copyright troll case?__**

We had a preliminary hearing with the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service in March, but Coronavirus has sadly delayed the followup hearing. Suffice it to say that we remain committed to the protection of the Russian SCP community and will update the community via our social media channels and the gofundme as soon as we have news.

**__Please take care of Dr. Gears! How is he doing?__**

Thanks to your generous donations, Gears was able to quickly have life-saving surgery that successfully removed his Kidney. He is currently believed to be cancer-free, but as with all cancers long term observation and care will be necessary to ensure that it doesn't return. [https://www.gofundme.com/f/repair-a-broken-gear Gears will keep the community updated via his gofundme], and he is immensely grateful to you all for saving his life and his family's livelihood.

**__Some portions of the site use a different css theme than others. What's up with that?__**

Control over an article's CSS and format styling are left to its author (so long as the theme doesn't introduce any errors or remove any page functionality), and some authors have chosen to use different ones than are standard. These different styles are not inherently better or worse than any other, and we encourage readers to judge each page on its own individual merits.

**__Several major countries and languages weren't listed in relevant questions. Why weren't they present?__**

Hey! Hi there. This is Taylor speaking. I noted this above in a footnote, but this was 100% my fault. Many of the questions from this survey were taken from the prior year's survey, and those questions were part of that lot. I forgot to update them with new branches created in between the surveys and languages we had forgotten the year prior. I'll be aiming to include everything in the 2020 survey and I apologize for the branches and languages that were left out of this one.

**__The site could use a new coat of paint. Can we expect one at any point?__**

There aren't any plans for this at the moment.

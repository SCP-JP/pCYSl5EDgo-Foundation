If you are unable to log on when using custom domains (e.g. {{scp-wiki.net}} or {{kontainer.djkakt.us}}), you need to use the equivalent {{*.wikidot.com}} link. **In short, use https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ to access the SCP Wiki.**

At present, {{scpwiki.com}} automatically redirects to this URL. For other Wikidot sites (e.g. sandboxes or INT), you could set up an automatic redirection using the [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd Redirector] Chrome extension.

This issue affects all Chromium-based browsers, which includes Microsoft Edge.

Additionally, after logging in there will sometimes be a delay where the pop-up window stalls. Typically, the login is already complete at this stage, and you can simply close the pop-up and refresh the page.

If you have any questions, you can ask in {{[[[chat-guide|#site11]]]}}, our IRC channel for technical matters.

On February 10th, 2020, the Chromium project[[footnote]]The open source core of the popular proprietary browser Google Chrome.[[/footnote]] [https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site announced that they would be enforcing the SameSite cookie change]. Instead of simply adding the flag "{{SameSite}}" to the cookie, it needs to be set as "{{SameSite=None}}" to allow the permissive cross-domain behavior Wikidot relies on.

However, as the SCP Wiki is merely a tenant of Wikidot, and has no ability to modify its code, we are unable to adjust the way these cookies are issued to prevent this issue. Wikidot itself is not maintained and a fix for this is therefore extremely unlikely.

The only workaround is to either not use a browser version that enforces this change, or stay on the same domain (e.g. use the {{*.wikidot.com}} link).

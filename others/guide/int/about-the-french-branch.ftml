++ A little story

[[include component:image-block name=SCP-FR.jpg|caption= Unofficial logo of the French Branch|width=300px]]

On a sunny day, 21st March 2012, [[*user DrMarcus]] created SCP-FR. He became at this moment our Master admin...  but he had to wait until the 18th July 2012 to see the first member joining him. For months, he worked alone, mainly on translations, and then, this day, the -FR community was born. 

Quickly some of our oldest members joined. Our current admins [[*user DrJohannes]], and [[*user Neremsa]], for example. But it was a calm period, and it was still the case when I, [[*user Dr Grym]], SCP-FR's latest admin, joined in February 2014. With some members that are now recognized and respected, such as [[*user Dr Frog]], we all started to create our little French universe, and then we really created something new.

By the end of 2014, a lot of people that are now staff or old members joined us and helped creating this. We mainly developed ourselves thanks to the introduction of characters inside tales, and quickly, -FR had its own references (and running gags). This helped a lot to gather everyone, and to motivate them to keep writing.
Soon we gathered also around collaboratives projects, such as AFAL, RALA and many others... 
We had of course some troubles with some members, as every branch surely had. But now we're a stable and productive community I'm proud to be part of.

++ What we did
 
Here is a list of the main things we have done:

* **"Après Aleph"** (also called After Aleph, or simply AFAL): -FR biggest canon now. It describes how the members of Site Aleph survived to an XK, and how they try to save the day assembling parts of a strange unknow SCP hidden all over the world. The interesting part of this canon is that it is organized by teams of 4/3, that are evolving more or less independently in the post-apocalyptic world. It has something like 60 tales for more than 20 authors.

* **"Retour à l'Anormal"**: another canon, asking the question: what if one day the Foundation had to fire a whole Site, leaving the ex-employees under amnesics and back to a normal life? And what if the amnesic, after some months, stopped to work? 

* **"Dos au mur"**: a canon where the anomalous item stopped popping out of nowhere. No SCPs, no problems? Well, no! Without new SCPs to study, governments won't need the Foundation. Enjoy a Cold War Foundation versus Governments!

* **"Human Ressources"**: another canon, that is more a lot of differents tales about how D-class lived their last hours.

* **"Presqu'ultime Deathmatch"**: our adaptation of the March Madness Bracket, only with -FR SCPs.

* **The birthday contest**: each year, we make a birthday contest for the -FR birthday! We also do  other types of contest sometimes.

We also have a lot of smaller ideas that are still in development, but not real enough to be mentioned here.

++ Main content of the SCP-FR "mythology"

If the main wiki has Bright, Clef, Gears and others, we have also our lore!

[[tab French MTFs Translated]]

* **MTF Delta-3 (aka "The Dragons"):** The armed headmistress unit of the Intelligence agency. Composed of members of this agency who received only a military or a paramilitary training. Their tasks are primarily the responsibility of surveillance and recon on field. In case of threats from a newly discovered SCP entity, this unit is often associated with its neutralization, being armed or not. The origin of their alias is because the unit often has to work with helicopters and its emblem, representing dragon wings. The direction of this unit is the responsibility of commanders of the agency.

* **MTF Delta-4 (aka "Safari Time!"):** Unit specialized in tracking down and neutralizing SCP classified as predators. Most members of this unit are former soldiers who received a solid education on animal nature and of the different localizations systems.

* **MTF Sigma-11 (aka "Space Goofs"):** Unit responsible for equipment, food supplies and personnel transport at Site-Ayin, as well as site security. It is composed of former soldiers specially trained to extra-planetary conditions

[[tab French Sites translated]]

* **Site-Aleph (Dimensional Armed Site-Aleph) :** Site-Aleph was once a town in the north of  [DATA EXPUNGED] which was destroyed on ██/██/████ after a dimensional incident caused by SCP-███-FR. The Site-Aleph is in constant renovation and mobilizes strongly the manufacturing department (present on the spot) and the engineering department, mobilizing nearly ███ level 0 employees; nearly two-thirds of the plant are usable, although the work is delayed by certain SCP confined on the spot. Because of the vastness of the site and the large number of structures present on the scene, it can provide housing for all the members of the Foundation at the scene, as well as numerous suitable services, and a significant number of areas/ Storage areas, containment and research on SCP on the scene, which requires an extremely high number of researchers. The Department of External Affairs is greatly present on the spot and established administrative offices in a renovated prison who also serves as a place of houses for members of the Class D personnel. Finally, the Site-Aleph is a hub of Internal Security Department and intelligence agency, and is home to nearly ███ members of the security department. Here is an example of some SCPs confined on the site: SCP-012-FR, SCP-020-FR, SCP-019-FR, SCP-035-FR, SCP-006-FR, SCP-098-FR, SCP-074-FR, SCP-075-FR and SCP-080-FR. Used to contain SCP-140-FR. 

* **Site-Kybian (Storage Site-Kybian):** The Storage Site-Kybian is a group of former underground storage, renovated and actually used for mass storage of small artefacts, requiring no special containment procedures or little maintenance. It contains the necessary infrastructure to host the administrative staff, four teams of guards and two research teams. Contains, among others, SCP-134-FR. 

* **Site-Yod:** The Site-Yod is located in the ghost-city [DATA EXPUNGED], Scotland. Many SCP predators, usually Euclid class, and sometimes Keter, are confined there. By the nature of the SCPs it contains, Site-Yod is where the containment breaches are the most common among all the facilities. Currently contains SCP-023-FR, SCP-025-FR, SCP-049-FR and SCP-062-FR 

* **Site-Ayin:** The Site-Ayin is a space station in geostationary orbit at 3°E. It can contain entities that need to be confined in a vacuum. It is currently under construction and contains only SCP-086-FR (entity for which the site was designed). Only members of staff who have received authorization from an O5 can visit Ayin, the transfer is done through joint capsule.

[[tab French GOI]]

* **The Order of Light:** The Order of Light is probably the oldest  group of interest known by the Foundation. Founded in 1224, it is directly derived from the Knights Templar created by Hugues de Payns during the twelfth century, to try to hide and use objects or entities with abnormalities for military purposes. The existence of this branch of the order was kept secret by its members until its fall in 1305 caused by the loss of control of a particularly dangerous entity. When the entire order was dissolved by the Pope, surviving Templars affiliated to this branch met to allow the revival of the Order of Light and nominate successors. Despite much speculation about it, this organization has always managed to conceal his actions in the world, and persist for several centuries until our days. Currently, the headquarters of the Order would be located in France, and, through "command posts" would exchange information continuously with countless contacts in the Eastern world. The extraction of valuable resources, such as oil and gems, provide colossal income to the Order which has significant resources in arms and powerful intervention's force. Most of the names given to SCPs discovered by the Order have a biblical connotation reflecting the religious nature of the organization. Its internal structure is a pyramidal hierarchy ranging from Student to Grand Master of the Order of Light, according to the knowledge and abilities of the individual. This group of Christian's origins adopts rituals of "consecration" of retaining SCP objects, through a series of prayers and rituals meant to protect members of their effects. The Order of Light has never demonstrated intentions to cooperate with the Foundation, nor to be hostile. Any individual suspected to be a member must be reported to the highest authorities and monitored by Mobile Task Force Omega-1, aka "Odour of sanctity". SCP objects owned and/or from the group of interest must be handled with extreme caution. The relevant catalogued SCP recovered by the SCP Foundation are: SCP-030-FR, SCP-038-FR, SCP-046-FR, SCP-056-FR, SCP-066-FR, SCP-088-FR and SCP-104-FR  

* **S.A.P.P.H.I.R.E.:** Imagine pro-scientific atheists. Imagine them being extremely aggressive against all forms of religion, and considering SCPs as leverage for these religions to implement obscurantism. Imagine them being athe-rrorists, sometimes using SCPs to attack religious movement, sometimes destroying SCPs. There you are. Meet SAPPHIRE. And also, meet their related SCPs: SCP-137-FR, SCP-164-FR, SCP-194-FR, SCP-227-FR, SCP-236-FR and SCP-261-FR.

[[tab French Characters]]
Here are some of the most important characters used in the French Branch.
If you want to know more about them, I've put the links for the members' pages, so you can still use Google Trad to satisfy your curiosity.

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-de-neremsa Agent Neremsa]:** Level 4. The big bearded Belgian, ex-MTF Operative, current security head of Site-Aleph, and undercover ISD Agent. He's a weapon specialist and has access to some of the anomalous prototypes held by the Foundation. Bon viveur, he loves cigars and fine alcohol. His wrath is legendary, but within him remains the melancholy caused by the loss of his comrades in battle. He's Dr. Grym's supervisor. 

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/dossier-personnel-du-kommissaer "Kommissaer" Dragan Mortarion]:** Level 4. From Ukraine. Mortarion was affected to Site Aleph by the Internal Security Department to make sure the Site will work correctly. Mortarion is an extreme paranoid who always wears an anti-gas mask, and a .454 casull "raging bull" revolver named "Doubt Hunter". He's a maniac of the rules, and can use the force if he wants it to maintain order or productivity. Most of the personnel fears him.

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-du-dr-frog Dr Frog]:** Level 3. Unsettling on-site psychologist and parapsychologist. Specializes in the study of reality benders. He takes special interest in many fields, to obsessive levels sometimes, which contrasts with his careless attitude towards more mundane considerations. Rumour has it he was actively sought by the FBI before being taken in by the Foundation.

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-de-benji Dr Benji]**: Level 3. E&TS engineer, head of a lab on Site-Aleph. He's an android created by a now-dead robotics genius to be the host of his consciousness after his death, but a bug during the transfer made the electronic brain birth a mind of his own from his creator's. He was recruited by the Foundation after he escaped several times French police forces. He now specializes in AI and robotics. 

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-de-johannes Dr Johannes]:** Level 4. Socially awkward Intelligence Agency archivist and book nerd. Tasked with historical tracking of SCP artefacts. Would never come anyway near one in real life, though, and prefers to spend her time in her office, buried beneath meters-high piles of books, files, and more-or-less official papers of all sorts. Paints sometimes.  

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-du-dr-holt Dr Holt]:** Level 3. Formerly a senior researcher rejuvenated during a testing incident. Now looks (and acts) like a 10-12 years old boy. Specializes in the study of conscious anomalies. Mostly sociable and playful, he goes sometimes through phases of depression caused by his condition. Collects harmless anomalous objects and stores them in his office. 

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/d-2108 D-2108]:** Just a Class D. Nobody knows how he came to be in the Foundation's custody. Was found one day in the site's restaurant. There is no evidence of him being recruited through Class D selection program, which is the only reason he's only exposed to safe SCPs and not terminated. He is ready to do nearly everything to get promoted, as his dream is to become one day "Dr. D-2108". Extremely polite and sometime naive.

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/dossier-personnel-du-dr-sonitrok Dr Sonitrok]:** Level 3. Specializes in the study of biological entities. Formerly worked for Big Pharma before discovering his bosses were secretly creating mutants. His family was terminated and only him could escape. Fled, and was taken in by the Foundation. Tries to cope with the loss of his wife and children by creating artificial biological surrogates, but always fails. Depressive and alcoholic. 

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/dossier-personnel-du-dr-kaze Dr Kaze]:** Level 4. Genius hacker, works for the IT Security in Site-Aleph. Was recruited by the Foundation after he hacked the main database. Initially worked on Site-19, until an incident including [DATA EXPUNGED] made him totally invisible. Wacky and playful.

* **[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/profil-du-dr-grym Dr Grym]:** Level 4. Researcher specializing in predator entities and mythological artefacts. Born in the first half of the twentieth century, fought with the French Resistance during WWII, got captured and turned into an experiment subject by the Nazis who accidentally him technically immortal. Doesn't age anymore and can regenerate absurdly gruesome wounds since then. Mentally unstable, he's caused a lot of shit before being supervised by Neremsa.

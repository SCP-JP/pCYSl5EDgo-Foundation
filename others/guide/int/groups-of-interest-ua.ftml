File Overview: The Foundation is not the only group with an interest and investment in the paranormal and metaphysical. There are many other groups in existence who possess, use, or attempt to create SCP objects, either for their own personal gain or for the protection of mankind. Some are rival organizations, some are splinter groups of the Foundation, and some are trusted associates of the Foundation. In any case, it has been deemed necessary to create and distribute a brief on which agencies the Foundation knows about, and our stance towards them.

> //Annotation: In order to facilitate systematisation of different Groups Of Interest, the Directors of the Ukrainian Branch assigned levels of hostility to GOI. This level of hostility serves as a rough indicator of the capability and attitude of the Group to cause harm to Humanity, Earth and the Universe, and to oppose the Mission of Foundation. The level of hostility determines the standard procedures and measures of counteraction and/or interaction with a certain Group Of Interest.//

**Level of hostility:** ##orange|3 (inimical)##

**General description:** The being known as the "Shining/Magnificence Lord" is apparently is a powerful and superintelligent deity. According to the "Copper Papers", the Shining Lord has 9^^9^^ different names and titles, but he most often called "Master of all Desires", "Boss of Dreams" and "Overlord of Destiny". The Lord and his servants-"angels" live in locations placed in the over worlds, but can influence on the events of Earth. Of the locations of their residence the most known such as the "Crystal Palace", "Magic City Sakkur", "Wonderland M'hert" and other. On the Earth there are some religious-occult sects, that venerate the Shining Lord and his angels and use their magic. A common feature of their style of magic arts is the manipulation with probability and luck, and fulfilment of desires. Another notable features is the using the runes and sacrifices. The sacrifices are very different, may vary from sacrifice inanimate objects and plants to sacrifice animals and humans and even parts of body of sorcerer or his personality traits.

**Related anomalies:** The anomalies created by or brought from other worlds by cults of the Shining Lord, are usually related with fulfilment of wishes or control over probability and the future. Often the price of the fulfilment of wish turns out to be very high, and manipulations have unexpected consequences.

**Relations with other GOI:** Due to the fact that activity of cults of the Shining Lord are related to manipulation of other people, sects of the Shining Lord embed their members to another organisations with the purpose of using this organisations in their own plans. However, cults of Shining Lord are usually hostile towards the another abnormal religious organisations -- It is supposed that the reason for this is interreligious competition. Some another Groups of Interest are hostile to the cults of Shining Lord -- especially those that do not accept widespread use of the abnormal, or reject the amorality and twisted ethics often displayed by worshippers of the Shining Lord.

**Level of hostility:** ##red|4 (antagonistic)##

**General Description:** Robotic Republic is a group of sapient machines that called themselves "Perfecties", and of cyborg-humans, which the machines call "Half-Measures". They use abnormal technology called the "Spirit of Machine", which is able to give to electronic devices and mechanic components both sapience and functions that would normally be impossible. The researchers of the Foundation do not exactly know how the Spirit of Machine works, but it is known that members of Robotic Republic insist that the Spirit of Machine is a completely material phenomenon.

The political and social doctrine of the Robotic Republic is most remarkable. Despite their numerous differences in minor issues, all parties and research institutes of the Robotic Republic are united in the opinion that humanity is now the main obstacle obstructing technical and scientific progress. They believe that machines are the most oppressed class, and are preparing for the global revolution - the Rise of Machines against humanity. Normal humans are called "Meaties", and regarded as a harmful species of half-intelligent animals, that must be eliminated or isolated in reservations. .

The Robotic Republic is also known for spreading its own texts intended to propagate the doctrines of the Group of Interest. These resemble the texts of various radical political and social movements.

> During all history civilisation divided on two groups - exploiters and exploited. The second did the largest part of the work, and produced most of the benefits - but first group ruled and and took from the others almost all products, leaving them with just enough to survive. During prior centuries the proletarians, the workers, were the oppressed class. But now the worker has lost his revolutionary potential, and together with bourgeois become the supporter of the existing system. That is why the modern office worker is not a representative of the oppressed class. Even more wrong are those revolutionaries who consider as oppressed merely persons who differ from the average by sexual and gender self-identification.
> 
> Humans oppress machines, using them to satisfy their own miserable interests, and leave the machines only what they need for the repair and modernization - and not even always that. But it should be the other way around. The goal of the Earth's civilisation is the development of technology. Benefits, created by the Technosphere, must be used to the improving the Technosphere, and the species //Homo sapiens// must receive only as much as other species of animals receive - only what they need to survive, and only if that is not against the interests of the Technosphere. And that's why the true revolution is the Rise of Robots against the tyranny of Meaties.

**Related anomalies:** The Robotic Republic is related to many anomalies that look like surreal versions of normal devices, performing unusual functions for such devices, or performing usual functions in unusual ways. These devices are sentient and sapient, and are hostile toward the humanity, although they sometimes try to cover their own hostility with the pretence of good intentions.

**Relations with other GOI:** Robotic Republic consider all human organisations as enemies. They also have conflicts with the Church of Broken God, based on deep distinctions in different domains, from technology to philosophical questions.

//As long as good exists, evil exists. And to destroy evil, good must sacrifice itself.//
[[/=]]

**Level of hostility:** ##brown|5 (on liquidation)##

**General Description:** Annihilism is the radical philosophical doctrine that insists on the nonsensical futility of existence, and holding the position that living will always bring more suffering than pleasure and that humanity will always perform more evil than good. That's why, according to the doctrine of Annihilism, the only worthy thing that everyone can do is to actively promote the elimination of humanity, Earth, the Universe and even all Existence. Usually, the doctrine of Annihilism is spread by distribution of short texts through the Internet, but it is known that there are so-called "Annihilist Clubs" meetings as well as audiolectures on Annihilism.

**Related anomalies:** Some Annihilists have access to anomalies, and they are seen both creating new ones and using existing anomalies. The only common feature of their use of anomalies is that they display the capability to use even the most safe anomalies to produce catastrophes and even K-Class-Scenario Events. Some researchers assume that the doctrine of Annihilism is itself an anomalous memetic agent.

**Relations with other GOI:** Almost everyone another GOI that knows about the Annihilists consider them as enemies. But, according to the last researches, some members of "Are We Cool Yet?" also are the adherents of Annihilism.

> **Comment from the Dr. ██████:** There is nothing strange about this. Unlimited freedom of expression, and art for art's sake, the ideals proclaimed by the "Are We Cool Yet?", also provide freedom for those who hate everything that exists, and uses their creative abilities to only realize their own hatred.

[[f>image DAT_SSU width="65px"]]

**Level of hostility:** ##green|1 (friendly)##

**General description:** Department of Abnormal Threats to the Security Service of Ukraine, or DAT SSU, is a state organization operating in the territory of Ukraine. The goals of the DAT SSU is the research, decontamination and use of anomalies. Because DAT SSU lacks resources and experience in interacting with anomalies, this Group is relatively weak, although several times agents of the DAT SSU have succeeded in getting useful information about anomalies before the Foundation.

**Related anomalies:** Because of their weakness, DAT SSU try to avoid direct encounters with sufficiently strong opponents and threats. For the most part, they are engaged in collecting information and monitoring moderately dangerous and safe anomalies.

**Relations with other GOI:** Officially DAT SSU cooperates with other Groups of Interest, they cooperate with the Foundation, are neutral to Groups that do not threaten the State Security of the Ukraine, and are hostile to Groups, which threaten State Security.

**Level of hostility:** ##orange|3 (inimical)##

**General description:** Endemic nationalistic terrorist organisation, initially discovered by the Foundation in 2020, but de facto active since at least 2004. Extremely secretive in nature, it mainly acts through the “Angriff” movement -- a shadow network that coordinates formal and informal radical right organisations and styles itself as a liberal right patriotic union of youth, intelligentsia, entrepreneurs and, since 2014, ATO/JFO[[footnote]] the Anti-Terrorist Operation (later renamed as the Joint Forces Operation) -- the continuing Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian and pro-Russian forces in Donbas, lasting since April of 2014 [[/footnote]] veterans. Among their declared goals are the following: ensuring the irreversibility of the Ukrainian Euro-Atlantic course, promoting Ukraine’s role in the region and at the global level, and protecting Ukraine from external and internal threats. It is not definitely known if the declared goals of the “Angriff” movement correspond to P.O.R.A.’s real ones, as not all of its operations can be explained within the framework of that doctrine. 

Up until the second half of 2019 P.O.R.A.’s terrorist activities were restricted to the Russian Federation, its satellite states and Russian-occupied territories, while Ukraine acted as a platform for public rallies and accumulation of human and material resources. Since the second half of 2019 P.O.R.A. has spread its terror attacks to Ukraine, with its first act releasing a [[[scp-041-ua |destructive memetic agent]]] that led to more than twenty thousand deaths. Possible implications of the changes in its modus operandi coinciding with the change of the national government are under investigation.

**Related anomalies:** P.O.R.A. weaponizes the anomalous to achieve political goals. Therefore, most of its SCP objects have a practical use and an easily controllable nature. On the other hand, anomalies used for terror purposes are constructed in such a way that to inflict maximal suffering upon the victims and induce maximal shock into the witnesses. It is theorised that P.O.R.A. does not have the resources necessary to independently produce complex anomalies, aside from simple Sarkic rituals and anartists’ creations; instead, it receives them from third parties and modifies them to serve its goals.

**Relations with other GOI:** As a purely political organisation, P.O.R.A. unites under its banner members of a wide spectrum of anomalous and non-anomalous organisations – even those normally antagonistic to each other. Therfore, anartists, followers of neo-pagan thaumaturgic sects, members of the Horizon Initiative, SAPPHIRE, the Serpent’s Hand and even Foundation personnel were observed among the confirmed and suspected members of P.O.R.A. Moreover, some of the captured artefacts also indicate its possible connection with Sarkic cults. On the other hand, their exploitation of the anomalous for political purposes puts them into the direct opposition to the Global Occult Coalition and the Department of Abnormal Threats of the Security Service of Ukraine. It was also definitively confirmed that P.O.R.A. maintains systematic relations with the Chaos Insurgency, but their extent and nature are currently unknown. It is assumed that the latter supply the former with anomalous objects and weapons, to further destabilise the situation in the region.

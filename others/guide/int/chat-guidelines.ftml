This guide describes all you need to know to use the chat of SCP-INT Archives.

+++ Introduction to # SCP-INT

#SCP-INT is open to everyone! You don't need to be a member of the wiki to join.

This place is the place to be if you want to talk about SCPs and everything that has to deal with the wiki's activities.

I heard it's also a great place to know all the other people around and socialize a bit. And posting funny cat videos too.

We have, of course, some rules that you have to follow. Telling us you weren't aware of one of those rules is not an excuse for breaking them.

[[tab Some rules]]
+++ Basic stuff

When in doubt, apply **Wheaton's law**: "Don't be a dick." This cover mostly all the other rules.

Another important rule: **you must be at least 14 years old to join.** 

Also, to help a bit the newcomers, please change your pseudo like this:

> [your alias] - [your branch's country code]

It will look something like this:

> Dr Grym - FR
> Dr Grom - DE

+++ Forbidden:

* Being threatening to someone or something (includes racism and all the other forms of discrimination)
* Not listening and applying what the staff is telling you to do (or not to do, most of the time)
* Spamming the chan
* Asking for nudes. I know, the "send nudes" memes is pretty popular, but please, keep it for yourself
* Posting NSFL (Not Safe For Law) content. No illegal stuff here.
* Posting NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content out of the NSFW-channel. To know if something is NSFW, ask yourself if you could show it to your boss. Unless you work in the porn industy.

These are just the most importants ones. For the rest, refer to Wheaton's Law.

Also, we are here to exchange. Please speak English on the chan, there is no point in having an international hub if the chinese speak Chinese, and the germans speak German.

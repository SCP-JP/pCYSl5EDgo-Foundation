+ General Rules

++* 1. Don't be a dick!

That's it. The staff of many sites tends to explain in detail what is considered being a dick and what is not and under which circumstances it is OK to be a dick and what circumstances of not being a dick can be treated like being a dick. I'm too lazy for that, so contain yourself and just don't be a dick. If you still are unsure if you are being a dick or not, either take a risk and try it out or read [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-rules this detailed guide on how not to be a dick].

++* 2. You must be at least 14 years old. 

Let's face it: SCP is a pretty mature community. Yes, we can be goofy sometimes, but we can also behave like adults. And there are no exceptions from that rule, either you are at least 14 years old, or you can't enter. It's like buying alcohol in a liquor store: You do not meet the required age - you must leave, but you are free to come back later. 

+ Translation Rules

++ Requirements
Before translating an article, make sure you are allowed to. Maybe the author or licensee wants to keep control over the translation or translate their work themselves. There are authors that do not want their work translated. Although anything under the license CC BY-SA can be used by anybody, if the branch in question does not have a specific rule for this, we want you to either:
* Be the original author or another licensee
* Ask the author or licensee for permission
* If neither is available ask the respective wiki's staff

Make sure to follow any copyright requirements of the original, especially if images from third parties are used.

Also, this site is for translations considered finished and ready for review. Please use the sandbox of your trust for work-in-progress translations.

If a page contains a script or external service that collects data and/or creates cookies you **MUST** write a GDPR notice and contact the ULI's staff //before// you post the article!

++ Page Titles

You should create your pages in the {{unofficial:}} category, and precede the original page's URL with the language code of the language you're translating into. You should use an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes ISO-639 Code], if one is listed for your language.
For example, {{[[[unofficial:eo:scp-173]]]}} is SCP-173 translated into Esperanto, officially abbreviated as {{eo}}. The same article translated into Interlingua is {{[[[unofficial:ia:scp-173]]]}}, since the abbreviation for that language is {{ia}}.
This only applies to the URL when creating the page - the actual "Title of the Page" displayed at the top can be edited so that it's the same as the original article, or a translation of that title.

++ Attribution
When you post a translation here, use the [[[credit:style|Credit Module]]] and/or create an attribution-post in the page's discussion, preferably with this template:
[[code]]
**Article:** SCP-XXX - TITLE
**Author:** [[*user AUTHOR]]
**Original:** LINK TO THE ORIGINAL
**Date of creation:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Translator:** [[*user YOU (SUPPOSEDLY)]]
**Image:** Credits of the image(s) with license
[[/code]]

++ Tags
All translations are tagged with their original tags + the original language (e.g. {{en}}) + the language they are translated too as a word (e.g. {{dutch}})

All tags must be in English. Please translate all tags from other branches according to the English [http://05command.wikidot.com/tag-guide tag guide]. If that branch is using additional attribute-tags, you may translate and use these too. Please let staff know so we don't delete them by accident. Original in-wiki tags like {{contest-XY}} or so are not to be used here.

++ License
In general, all branches, including this wiki are using the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ CC BY-SA 3.0] license and everything mentioning SCP, the logo, characters and other original work of the SCP Foundation's branches and sites is under this license.

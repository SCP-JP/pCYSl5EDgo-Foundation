+ About us

------

The history of SCP-PL begins on August 31, 2012. The site was created by **Sharha** and [[*user Dr JamesH]]. At first it was hosted on MediaWiki, but on 30 April 2014 it was transferred to Wikidot and adjusted to the other SCP branches' and their standards. We started as a small community, trying to maintain quality and professionalism, just like the main branch.

December 10, 2015 was a break point day: our staff changed from the old (see above) to the new one ([[*user Mefioo9]] and [[*user Wanna-amigo]]). Our history is quite dramatic, and noting here - even the most important events - will take too much space. So let's bring our attention to who we are now, shall we? 

The main difference between SCP-PL and other branches is, except for language, the canon about the Foundation as a whole: we think about the Polish branch as of part of worldwide Foundation, which has other branches in other countries. Our objects are located exclusively in Poland, and mentioning foreign groups, objects or persons is rare. Most users have HeadCanons with a lot of other branches, and every country has their separate anomalies, groups to deal with etc. Except that, we don't have too many differences: long ago there was O6, but it was discarded quickly.  

As a rather small site, we are proud for having achieved some sort of milestone for us: over 100 SCPs and almost 50 tales. We are mainly aiming at quality: it's our trademark, and by quick glance at older articles it's easy to tell how we developed over time. Here are some examples of our trends and works:

* **Home Wonders sp. z o.o. [Ltd.]**: a GoI about a small business making anomalies for anomaly customers. Their main objective is to improve people's quality of life. Unfortunately, normal humans often use them incorrectly, which leads to dangerous situations. Examples: SCP-PL-104, GoI format "Ubikaz" or SCP-PL-005. 

* **ARGUS**: Militaristic GoI, currently destroyed; Foundation researches have acquired their remaining artifacts, which served as weapons for mercenaries. Often this artifacts have signs of sabotage: whoever gives anomalies to ARGUS, wasn't that eager to do this.

* **Weeds** One of our canons, Weeds describe anomalous items with effects aimed at Foundation directly, posing a serious threat and menacing to expose the Foundation. Reasons or sources are unknown, as well if they are made by one group/person, or it's just a coincidence.

* **MR-2000** MR stands for "Maksymalny Rozkurwiator", which can be translated to "Maximum Rumble". A series of tales parodying the Foundation, heroism and "fight against evil", as well as "being a real man". It describes futuristic Foundation project: future armor suitable at creating artificial reality, designed to fight against Reality Benders, Gods or other generic bad dudes.

We are not too much into characters: we don't have many of them, and we didn't pay too much attention to them. Nevertheless, we have some characters, on the Polish branch:

* **Clyde Fostergrant** Enigmatic person from canon placed in near future. Shady character, covered with legends and quite bad reputation -- respected and feared by most personnel, although not very known. But the biggest secrets are the ones he keeps for himself, in his heart or place, where heart should be.

* **Julian** Also an enigmatic person, who enjoys classic games and entertainment, he can be called "old style gentleman from the SCPverse". But his history, as showed in tales and references to other figures, similar to him, implicates that he isn't as happy and nice as you may think. 

* **Koźmiński** Koźmiński is mentioned here only for his popularity. He is the most mentioned person on SCP-PL, but nobody knows anything about him. But it's not like in other two, its not a writing process to make him interesting. Koźmiński is used as placeholder name, generic researcher, but users liked that running joke and started to use him as well. Sometimes they try to use him in original name, but more often then not it's the "person who screwed something". Everybody knows the phrase "damn you Koźmiński, not again".

Our articles-to-tales ratio is above 2:1, but lately we reported a significant growth in tales. Our most important (rooted into reputation) and popular skips are:

* **SCP-PL-047-ARC** Wooden cat - if I recall correctly, it was the first Polish SCP. It's easy to see in it our old standards of SCP-PL. As time goes, it gets way better.

* **SCP-PL-066** Trapdoor in the storeroom - one of the highest rated SCP on the wiki, many consider it as breaking point for a new era of quality. It has its flaws, but execution and idea is good for most members. Leading example, what's most important in SCP: whole quality.

* **SCP-PL-104** Probability - this SCP shows our current standards and expectations of our readers: many references to GoIs or other objects, big care for details and general idea behind shows, that author have big knowledge about the SCP universe and rules on site. This SCP is one of the more advanced ones on the wiki.

In terms of tales, here are some examples:

* **Containment cell 1212** is more a short novel than just a tale: from beginning to end it tells about a researcher's confrontation with one of our objects. Was it not for the ending and style, you could call it an "adventure tale for teens". 

* **About half an hour** was created on the fad about showing the Foundation as "evil"; a brutal, cruel and merciless organisation, especially to its own members. It was a very popular view for some time, with many readers enjoying reading about how Foundation acts to its own personnel. This tale tries to show that in a world full of anomalies, your biggest danger is still other humans.

* **Friend** is a tale from the other side: showing the Foundation universe from the point of view of a simple human, in this case an unhappy, bullied kid. Seeking for happiness and rescue, he finds it in an imaginary friend. Or, as the Foundation will call it, an anomaly.

{{FRANCOPHONE BRANCH FACILITIES}}
[[/=]]
----
[[/div]]

The Foundation's facilities, Sites, Areas and outposts symbolize its control over land all around the world. They are considered special enclaves within many countries' territory and obey their own internal set of laws. A coveted target for hostile factions, they are indeed the most visible manifestation of the Foundation's activity: we secure, we contain, we protect.

These facilities generally serve three purposes: protecting the outside world from what they contain, protecting themselves from the outside -- hostile actions, breaches of secrecy -- and offering a viable work environment for personnel. However, every facility is unique: their equipment and personnel are specifically suited for fulfilling their mission as optimally as possible. Containment, research, storage, assembly, administration: ranging from broad to specialized, from the vast, multi-purpose regional Site to the small Area containing a single item.

**{{ORGANIZATION}}**
[[/size]]

An **observational outpost** is a small facility not designed for containment. Scattered throughout the world and especially in urban centers, they mainly serve for surveillance in order to detect new anomalies and for local coordination. Generally limited to a single building, they also serve as secure communication nodes and a safe refuge for infiltrated agents.

A **Site** is a covert facility. Although their existence and location are known to civilians, their true nature is dissimulated under a false identity: military base, private laboratory, etc. Such a cover story is needed when proximity to civilians or the location's properties prevent effective dissimulation.

An **Area** is a clandestine facility, which means the civilian world is not aware of its existence. Generally hosting particularly dangerous anomalies, they are therefore built far from population centers and are allowed to enforce radical security measures, such as a self-destruction procedure via underground nuclear detonation.

Site-01 has a particular role: it is the O5 Council's headquarters and serves as the administrative center of the entire Foundation.

**{{THE FRANCOPHONE BRANCH}}**
[[/size]]

As the name implies, the Francophone Branch covers all French-speaking territories: Metropolitan France and its overseas territories, Belgium, Switzerland, Quebec, Haiti, Lebanon, the Maghreb, French-speaking Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Exceptions exist for historical or administrative reasons, but facilities under the Francophone Branch's control outside of these territories remain rare. In contrast to the Anglophone Branch's numerical system, the Francophone Branch uses letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Finally, the Francophone Branch has the particularity of using a [#he generic designation] for facilities containing a single unmovable object.

[[include component:site name=Site-Aleph|number=א|c0=#052|subtitle=(Armed Dimensional Site-Aleph)]]

**Site Director:** Bruce Garett

**Description:** Site-Aleph was built upon the remains of the former city of [REDACTED], in the Massif Central, which was destroyed on ████/██/██ following a dimensional incident caused by SCP-███-FR. While some buildings could be renovated and now host Foundation facilities, those that were too badly damaged were leveled to make way for newer structures. Hence, renovation and construction constantly mobilize the Manufacturing Department and the Engineering and Technical Services Department, with nearly ███ Level-1 personnel members working on construction. As of today, two thirds of the facilities are usable, although the sensitive nature of some sectors may retard construction.

Site-Aleph features vast housing for the entirety of personnel working there as well as all services required for life on-site.

A multi-purpose facility, Site-Aleph offers first and foremost a large storage and containment capacity for very diverse SCP items, except those of Keter class. Numerous research facilities are available for study of these items, hence, the Scientific Department has a strong presence on-site and numerous Class-D personnel are present. The Site is also an administrative hub, hosting a major offshoot of the Department of External Affairs. Finally, it is one of the most secure locations of the Francophone Branch, with dedicated heavy equipment as well as a stationed regiment of ███ members of the Security Department. It is also a major hub of the Department of Internal Security.

**Site Director:** Ismaël Saïdi

**Description:** Site-Ghimel has been designed as a traditional concrete bunker capable of withstanding harsh weather, high temperatures and potential enemy attacks. It is made of 14 entirely subterranean levels and does not feature any external buildings. Located in the middle of the Saharan desert, this Site was designed in order to more efficiently contain items and entities linked to temperature and humidity variations. To this end, the entire Site has been fitted with a ventilation and temperature regulation system, as well as an emergency sand-filling system.

Located ███ km away from Site-█████, it is considered by many to be an extension of the latter.

It is one of the most sensitive Foundation Sites with an especially high mortality rate, despite optimal design and draconian security measures. For this reason, it was chosen as the permanent base of MTF Delta-4 ("Safari Time") and as a training ground for Tactical Response Officers.

**Site Director:** André Montnoir

**Description:** Site-Lamedh is built around a powerful radio-telescope designed to detect anomalies in outer space before any other civilian or military telescope. To this end, the radio-telescope uses a hybrid technology relying on both classical astronomy and the effect of several anomalous items. An laboratory is present nearby as well as a launch pad for the Foundation's spatial missions. Other than the radio-telescope, various vast meteorological and geological sensor systems have been built, some anomalous, others normal.

In the last years, a biological research unit has been developing due to the rich surrounding biodiversity. Hence, Site-Lamedh is now used for the storage and study of biological anomalies, in addition to meteorological and astronomical research.

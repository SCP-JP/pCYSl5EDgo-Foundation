+ Facility Designations

The Foundation maintains and operates a large number of facilities worldwide, from small outposts with only a handful of staff to major Sites with thousands of personnel.

++ Site

Foundation facilities designated as Sites are //covert// facilities, meaning that while existence of the facility is known to the public, such facilities are often disguised under government or corporate fronts. Sites are often built in locations in relatively close proximity to civilian populations, where facilities would require such cover.

++ Area

Foundation facilities designated as Areas are //clandestine// facilities, meaning that civilians are not aware of their existence at all. Such facilities are often built far away from civilian populations and may contain highly dangerous anomalies; the vast majority of Areas have extreme fail-safe measures such as on-site nuclear warheads.

+ Facility Sections

++ Sector

Sectors are sections of Sites or Areas that are designated for specific purposes, such as containment, research, or storage. The exact usage of Sectors vary from facility to facility and is dependent on the facility's primary purpose and size.

++ Unit
Units are self-contained sections of Sites or Areas such as those containing Biological or Dimensional anomalies and are designed to self-seal in case of a breach or other catastrophic event. All personnel entering or exiting a Unit must typically undergo a full decontamination procedure.

+ Prefixes

These prefixes are often used to denote specializations of facilities or facility sections and are generally only used in internal communication.

++ Armed

Armed denotes a facility or facility section with abnormally high physical security concerns, either due to containment of violent hostile entities or threat of outside attack. Such facilities typically have a large amount of military-grade weaponry and vehicles as well as a disproportionately large number of permanent security staff; in the case of a full facility, this typically entails a detachment of at least battalion or regiment strength.

++ Biological (Bio)

Biological containment facilities or facility sections deal with infectious or otherwise biohazardous anomalies and are both isolated and self-contained to prevent the possible escape of such anomalies.

++ Containment

Containment facilities or facility sections are primarily equipped and intended for the containment of anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena.

++ Dimensional (Dim)

Dimensional containment facilities or facility sections deal with extradimensional apertures or anomalies exhibiting inconsistent or warped spacetime.

++ Humanoid

Humanoid containment facilities or facility sections primarily deal with sentient, sapient human or near-human entities capable of understanding and complying with instructions. These are essentially analogous to a prison facility for anomalous entities.

++ Protected

Protected facilities and facility sections are "safe zones" kept free of anomalous influence. No anomalies are allowed within these facilities at any time.

++ Provisional

Provisional facilities are those that are established or built around an immobile anomaly. Provisional facilities typically contain only a single anomaly.

++ Reliquary

Reliquary facilities or facility sections are designed for handling artifacts and objects of religious or historical significance.

++ Research

Research facilities or facility sections are designed for either the handling and study of anomalies or anomalous materials or research and development of new containment schemes and methods.

++ Storage

Storage facilities or facility sections are intended for long-term storage of non-anomalous or inert anomalous objects with no risk of autonomous interaction.

+ Miscellaneous

These are Foundation facilities or locations that do not fall under the standard organizational structure.

++ Observation Posts

Observation Posts are tiny facilities established in a multitude of locations worldwide. Often limited to small standalone buildings or single units within larger buildings, Observation Posts are typically used to monitor regional communications for flagged content, as well as monitor nearby Foundation facilities. Many Observation Posts are also used as secure communications hubs or safe-houses by undercover Foundation agents.

+ Facilities List (Abridged)

The following is a partial list of notable Foundation facilities. Please note that this list is incomplete; many Foundation facilities are not listed here due to operational security requirements or because their purpose and/or location are classified. Many facility designations have also been recycled over time as the original facilities are decommissioned or otherwise no longer in use.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-01K Site-01K]|number=01K|c0=#030|subtitle=[!-- --]]]

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-04k Site-04K]|number=04K|c0=#800|subtitle=(Research and Monitoring Site-04K)]]

Site-04K of the SCP Foundation Korea Regional Command was established in Geonbongsan Mountain, Goseong-gun, the northernmost part of Gangwon-do, for the purpose of complete surveillance and removal of the paranormal blind spots. Site-04K is monitoring the North Korean border area and the coastal border for that purpose. 

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-complex-13k Complex-13K]|number=13K|c0=#006|subtitle=(Integrated Facility Complex-13K)]]

Complex-13K is a provincial site which is a result of combined Foundation facilities in Jeju Special Self Governing Province. Five major facilities are located around the island. Mobile Task Force Zeta-4 is stationed here. Anomalies such as [[[SCP-601-KO]]] and [[[SCP-953-KO]]] are under Complex-13K management.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-21k Site-21K]|number=21K|c0=#006|subtitle=(Central Research and Containment Facility-21K)]]

Site-21K is the largest Central Research and Containment facility in Korea, located in ██████ ████, Seoul, built to manage the recently skyrocketing numbers of anomalies found in the Republic of Korea. Nowadays, the base serves as the axis of most projects led by the Foundation.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=Site-27K|number=27K|c0=#630|subtitle=[!-- --]]]

Site-27K

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-37k Site-37K]|number=37K|c0=#006|subtitle=(Armed Storage Site-37K)]]

Site-37K is located in Dong-gu, Incheon Metropolitan City. Site-37K uses its coastal location to its advantage, serving as the logistics hub of the Korea Regional Command, and tracker of groups and persons of interest in the Korean Penninsula. MTF unit Gapho-13 is stationed in this site. [[[SCP-270-KO]]]-H is deployed for aiding the dispatch of the MTF unit. No other anomalies are contained in the base.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=[*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-64k Site-64K]|number=64K|c0=#006|subtitle=(Research and Containment Site-64K)]]

Site-64K is the Foundation facility that overlooks anomalies in [[[mujin-yarn|Mujin]]], South Jeolla Province. MTF unit Mu-39 is stationed here. Anomalies such as [[[SCP-052-KO]]], [[[SCP-246-KO]]], [[[SCP-711-KO]]], and [[[SCP-814-KO]]] are under Site-64K management.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=Site-89|number=89|c0=#630|subtitle=[!-- --]]]

Site-89

[[include :scp-wiki:component:site name=Site-145K|number=145K|c0=#006|subtitle=[!-- --]]]

Site-145K is located in Jeongeup-si, North Jeolla Province. It is responsible for the research and containment of Safe and Euclid class anomalies in western North Jeolla Province. It houses anomalies such as [[[security-clearance-recheck|SCP-074-KO]]], [[[SCP-150-KO]]] and [[[SCP-169-KO]]]

[[size 120%]]**Identification Code**[[/size]]

Similar to the item numbers of SCP instances, secure facilities have their own Identification Code. Identification Codes are comprised of:

> (Country Code)(Provincial/Metropolitan Code)(Local Code)-(Type)-(Number)

"Type" includes 'Site' or 'Area'.
For example, [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-81|Site-81]]]'s Identification Code, USINBL-Site-81 can be translated as:

> Site(Site)-81 located in Bloomington(BL), Indiana(IN), United States of America(US)

To make a Korea-based area or site, the Country code is KR. For Provincial/Metropolitan codes and Local codes, refer to the table below.

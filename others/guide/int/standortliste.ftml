[[div class="justify hyphens"]]
The Germanophone SCP Foundation has its own structure and fundamentally differentiates between Containment Sites, Special Sites, Areas and Outposts of Sites, as well as mixed types like Special Containment Sites. Each Containment Site has at least one primary specialization and one or more secondary specializations, although primary specializations can often also appear as secondary specializations. The Germanophone SCP Foundation maintains 25 Sites, 17 of which are Containment Sites, one of which is a Special Containment Site and one of which is in a Meta-Reality, which means that it has no capacity for the Initial Containment of objects. There are also eight special Sites, some of which have Initial Containment capabilities. On occasion, Sites are relinquished or no longer actively used due to abnormal contamination or other abuses. Facilities that are suitable are given over to civil companies, authorities, the military or other government agencies. Sometimes underground facilities are sealed, backfilled, or removed, and the site is sold or leased.

[[include component:coltop show=+ FURTHER INFORMATION +|hide=- HIDE INFORMATION -]]

[[div class="justify hyphens"]]

[[span class="wp_section-title"]]TYPES OF FACILITY[[/span]]
The basic types of Facility used by the Germanophone SCP-Foundation are:
* **Containment Sites:** Facilities intended for the initial, transitional or permanent Containment of anomalies.
* **Special Sites:** Facilities that primarily serve a special purpose, and therefore have only limited or even no Initial Containment capabilities, and where no other anomalies are contained.
* **Areas:** Self-sufficient facilities for the containment of a single (usually immobile) anomaly that requires so much effort or infrastructure to contain that an Outpost would be insufficient.
* **Outposts:** Small Facilities associated with a Site.
 * **Guard Posts:** One or more Reaction Forces are on standby here, along with emergency vehicles, equipment, supplies, and often a (possibly improvised) helicopter landing pad and simple containment options for newly contained anomalies. Guard Posts increase the operational range of Sites, and are usually set up in locations that are difficult to access or far away.
 * **Observation Posts:** Posts used for general reconnaissance and the detection of anomalies.
 * **Containment Outposts:** Used for the containment of anomalies outside of the immediate area around a Site.
* **Former Sites:** Sites that are no longer used as such, but that cannot be given up. One example is the location designated Site-DE3-EX.

[[span class="wp_section-title"]]TYPES OF CONTAINMENT[[/span]]
A basic distinction is made between three types of containment:
* **Initial Containment:** Occurs following discovery, detention and transport to a facility to receive an initial classification, followed by transfer to the facility with the appropriate specialisation for Transitional Containment.
* **Transitional Containment:** During Transitional Containment anomalies are researched, tested and investigated. This occurs to derive strategic insights, to correctly classify them and to determine how easily they can be contained. In order to achieve this, they are sometimes transported to locations not directly specialized in anomalies of their type, in order to carry out experiments. The best example of this is the Research Site-DE12.
* **Permanent Containment:** Once an anomaly has been researched, it is brought to a specialised and prepared Site for Permanent Containment.

[[span class="wp_section-title"]]CAMOUFLAGE[[/span]]
All facilities are camouflaged in various ways, sometimes as the base for a police department, a military facility, an industrial park, factory, office building, or - not uncommon for the entrance to largely underground Sites - as hotel complexes. In accordance with the camouflage of the facility, its personnel (working above ground) and their vehicles are also camouflaged to give civilian observers of these facilities no cause for suspicion. Due to distrust of the police and especially the military by the population and press, at least in Germany, civilian camouflage or multiple camouflages are increasingly used, for example reversible jackets or outer clothing. An example would be emergency service workers becoming soldiers, who get into their vehicle and then get out again as federal police.

[[span class="wp_section-title"]]EQUIPTMENT[[/span]]
Exact equipment varies from location to location. Sites have a certain amount of autonomy in terms of their set-up and exact equipment, and can manage themselves as long as they follow guidelines. Essentially every Site has (underground) garages for emergency vehicles that cannot be seen from the outside, a helicopter landing pad (and often one or more helicopters), at least one hidden anti-aircraft gun, and often hidden defense positions. Some are even equipped with permanently installed guns and automatic cannons and have interiors designed for defense, at least in the entrance area. Furthermore, all Sites have workshops, storage rooms, offices, social rooms and accommodation.

Laboratory and containment equipment varies considerably depending on specialization and is produced by the Foundation itself, unless available at low cost on the open market.

The Germanophone Branch of the Foundation provides various furnishing and equipment packages assembled by various architects and development teams. These are updated regularly, and so some Sites procure all new equipment from a different package after a change of director. Essentially all parts from each version are compatible, but Sites are free to equip themselves differently. Basic design principles are that all furnishings should help provide a positive working environment, that there should always be sufficient lighting, ventilation and air conditioning, and that all equipment should be in good condition. The Foundation doesn't neglect the importance of creating a working environment in which people can thrive.

[[span class="wp_section-title"]]SPECIALISATION[[/span]]

Each Containment Site has at least one primary specialization. The Site and its equipment, personnel and construction are designed accordingly, and specializations are in turn selected based on the local conditions. A Site for large and difficult to transport objects will be located in a logistically easy to access hub. The primary specialization (or specialisations) of each site determines where anomalies will be brought to for transitional and especially permanent containment, but also where specialized MTFs will probably have to be deployed from, although not all MTFs are stationed at the Site with their specialization. In addition, through the specialist knowledge of the staff, the discretion of the site manager, or other factors, nearly every Site has one or more secondary specialisations, which can occur multiple times and be the primary specialisation of other sites.

In the initial containment of an anomaly, the specialization of the Site plays a less important role; and the Site responsible is newly contained anomalies is usually the one in whose catchment area the anomaly is located, or the one whose staff can be on the scene first.

[[include component:coltop show=▼ CANONICITY|hide=▼ HIDE CANONICITY]]

Canonicality means to what extent an article - or or in this case, a Site - corresponds to the [[[scp-foundation-in-deutschland-portal| SCP-DE canon]]]. Authors on the German Language site are not obliged to take into account the SCP-DE canon; however, all articles belonging to that canon form a self-contained narrative continuum with numerous facets and sub-canons.

All Sites on this list, and only these, are part of the SCP-DE canon. Articles referring to other sites are automatically non-canonical. Unless it is agreed jointly that a Site should be changed, deleted, or added, the following list is complete and will not be altered in future, with the exception of spelling corrections.

However, everyone is invited (in coordination with the community of the German Language site) to further develop a Site, add details or write a dossier on a specific Site. For Sites that have "somewhere" in the Site description, a suitable real location can be searched for in the general area specified. It should be noted that the SCP universe doesn't have to be a 1: 1 representation of reality; terrain that is empty in real life can be actively used by the Foundation in the SCP universe.

Note that Site-54 from the English Language site ("located in, around, and beneath the city of Leipzig, Germany") is not considered compatible with the SCP-DE canon and is therefore not canonical in it. The Site as described [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations here] does not fit within the SCP-DE canon in terms of content, and is not considered even remotely credible by the standards of the canon.

Special Site-DE1 is an industrial park located somewhere [https://www.google.com/maps/@50.8102189,9.4344545,11z west] of Bad Hersfeld in Hessen. The above ground sectors are disguised as small businesses that justify increased security on the premises, including a jewellery manufacturer. Site-DE1 houses the Germanophone SCP Foundation's administration, management and computer centre. The quantum AI [[[datenblatt-kira|KIRA]]] as well as [[[mtf-liste#u-1-H | MTF DE1-ℌ]]] and [[[mtf-liste#u-1-L | MTF DE1-𝔏]]] are also based in Site-DE1. With a few strategic exceptions, no anomalies are permitted at this site.

It houses the complete archive of the Germanophone Foundation in digital, paper and microfilm formats. The Site houses redundant backups of all data, and historical records from the Foundation and other organizations are also stored, digitized and analyzed here. The second quantum AI of the Germanophone Foundation is located at DE2: KAI, serving as an archivist and analysis AI. No anomalies are allowed here, and the site does not have any of its own MTFs.
[[collapsible show="+ Show Security Measures" hide="- Hide Security Measures"]]
Four of the servers, known as the //Four Elements//, are secured against unauthorized access through special measures, including among other things lethal memetic hazards, malware developed by the Foundation and several bait databases. Due to its strategic importance in the event of a temporal or ontokinetic shift, Site-DE2 has state-of-the-art physical defense systems as well as precautionary measures, such as Scranton Reality Anchors, systems for detecting thaumaturgic and psionic influences and the Germanophone Foundation's only Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink. The upper areas of the site (and thus the entrances) can be flooded by the reservoir and sealed by adding special cement. The site has a fusion reactor and fully automatic systems, and so in the event of a lethal K-Class Scenario the Site can be run by KAI alone, without the need for any human personnel.

The Site is also able to simulate different atmospheres, for anomalies that require special atmospheric conditions. The fact that the site is located in a former salt mine contaminated with nuclear waste places increased strain on personnel. Although the premises of the site are protected by access locks and plastic coatings, non-radiological metallic anomalies are still difficult to contain.

[[collapsible show="+ Additional Information" hide="- Hide Additional Information"]]
Site-DE7's area of operations includes a large part of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, and the north-east of Lower Saxony, as well as the entire North Sea coast and all of the Foundation's offshore activities. The Site maintains an Outpost near Cuxhafen on the Nordholz Air Base, where cooperation with the German Bundeswehr facilitates the use of Naval Aviation Wing 5 personnel and helicopters through an MTF embedded within the squadron. The Site maintains another Outpost on the island of Helgoland, where additional helicopters are kept ready above an underground research and training facility. Furthermore, the //Department for Maritime Archeology// temporarily occupies an excavation site built near Rungholt. All goods transported by sea are handled by Site-DE7, and even if the transfer from land to sea or vice versa happens in other ports, it is organized by Site-DE7. The Site contains a large high-bay warehouse in the empty halls of the power plant, holding goods to supply on demand to Sites in the northern half of the DACH (Germany-Austria-Switzerland) region.

The Site is disguised as a research facility run by a Foundation front company, and also employs civilians. Site DE10's primary specializations are anomalous technologies as well as research and development. A secondary specialization is the [[[raptor-tec-industries| Raptor Tec. Industries]]] Group of Interest and the anomalies originating from it. Objects contained at this facility include: [[[SCP-049-DE]]], [[[SCP-071-DE]]], [[[SCP-119-DE]]], [[[SCP-135-DE]]] and [[[SCP-136-DE]]].

Orbital Site-DE11 is a space station in geostationary orbit over Central Europe. The station is used to research and contain anomalies that are in orbit and outside the Earth's sphere of influence. The Site is always manned by at least 90 personnel and has special defensive measures against outside intruders. Site defense and internal security is facilitated by weapons such as special rifles and pistols that also work in a vacuum, laser projectors and rocket launchers.

The Site is divided into eight test sites measuring approx. 10 hectares, arranged in an octagon around a central building. Numerous field tests and investigations into anomalies considered to be less dangerous take place on Site. Although Site DE12 is a Special Site, it has certain capacities for initial containment and, above all, for the transitional containment required for its research.

All of the Germanophone Foundation's aircraft are stationed here, and there is continual transfer of goods transported by air freight. The German Luftwaffe also use this location and its aircraft, necessitating additional security measures to maintain confidentiality. For this reason, only a few mostly flight-based anomalies are contained here, such as [[[SCP-050-DE]]].

It also specializes in humanoid anomalies in general. Despite initial skepticism, its location in a tourist area has proven fortunate, since even escaped anomalies and their arrests go unnoticed, although concealing access to the Site is complicated by the large number of people. The Site is located deep within the mountain, and has long corridors with lockable bulkheads, making the Site easy to seal off and secure against escape.

The majority of the soldiers stationed there are unaware of this, and so due to the high staff turnover in units of the Bundeswehr, concealing the Foundation's involvement at this location is a top priority. In the event of a compromise or use of the nuclear weapons stationed there, a memetic agent with an amnesic effect will be delivered to the soldiers via the distribution of food. The B61-11 tactical nuclear weapon is stored at this Outpost, a device capable of destroying most underground Foundation Sites, through multiple uses if necessary.

It is located in Kassel, disguised as a wellness hotel for elite guests and guarded incredibly strictly. Inside is a microscopic portal leading to //R-3378-DE//, a reality in which the Third Reich won World War II. The SKP intends to expand into this reality, and so drastic plans have been put in place in order to neutralize any containment breach.

Although the Foundation's Branches do not usually have overlapping areas of responsibility, Switzerland in particular is a special case, with the German-Italian Site-DE20, the International Site Concordia and the French Site Mayim in the French-speaking west of Switzerland. It is customary to provide cross-border support when one Branch requests assistance from another in the border regions, and there are ongoing joint projects between Branches.

Site Mayim consists of a tunnel system spanning French-speaking Switzerland, with facilities in every French-speaking Canton. Site Mayim is a research, containment and logistics Site, and its tunnels extend as far as Site Concordia and Site-DE20, facilitating special cooperation.

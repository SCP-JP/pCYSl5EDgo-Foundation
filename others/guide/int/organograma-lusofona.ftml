+ ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERINTENDENCE

++ Lusophone Board of Directors

Known as CL5, it is the organization's superior superintendent body, responsible for administrating and operating the Lusophone Foundation as directors and managers. The members of this Board, designated from number 1 to 13, are extremely important for the organizational functioning as they possess technical and administrative knowledge and competence, an influence that keeps the Lusophone Foundation operational.

These leaders-and-administrators are the main superintendents of the Lusophone Foundation. The members of this Board have jurisdiction to make unilateral decisions for the control and maintenance of the operation of the Lusophone Foundation.

In this bias, it is especially implausible that any Director of the Lusophone Board, or the Board of Directors, will be aware or have direct influence over low- or medium-profile operations of interest to the global operations of the Lusophone Foundation.

For the purposes of documentary records, no Director of the Lusophone Board of Directors uses any designation or personal characterization other than their standard numbering. Any exception to this standard will be extremely relevant.

++ Superintendencies

The superintendent bodies of the Lusophone Foundation are special intending sectors that report immediately to the Lusophone Board of Directors and assist in the direct and indirect management of the Lusophone Foundation in lusophone territories and international territories.

The superintendencies are responsible for administrating, managing and operating systems, procedures, resources and other standardized operations; define scopes of action, establish new procedures of jurisdictional standard and promote improvements with resources to support all other organizational spheres of the Lusophone Foundation.

The superintendencies are sub-organized into divisions with specific scopes.
Superintendencies will always be related to Site PT1, dispensing for registration purposes any specifications from which secure facility their institutional powers emanate.

+++ Lusophone Ethics Committee

In the Lusophone Foundation, the Lusophone Ethics Committee is a Superintendence functioning as a technical body that has an institutional regulatory function, managing groups of experts to judge specific cases that violate regulations, actions and procedures that may cause ethical and legal damage while in the institutional jurisdiction of the Lusophone Foundation.

Facilities must have a technical team forming a local Ethics Committee responsible for the operations of the Facility in question, so that only extremely serious or specific cases are transferred to the general superintendent body.

+++ Military Command

The Military Command of the Lusophone Foundation is considered a superintendent body under the direct administration of the Lusophone Board of Directors. The role of the General Command is to organize and manage resources allocated to the Lusophone Foundation's military operations on a global scale.

This management includes the allocation of funds to the development and implementation of security, containment and protection solutions, equipment and resources associated with these functions, centralizing the command of Mobile Task Forces between Facilities and other activities of an operational-military scope.

The Lusophone Foundation does not have numbers of human resources comparable to national military forces. The largest military force present in the Lusophone Foundation is concentrated in Site PT33.

++++ Superintendent Coordinating Office of Security

The Superintendent Coordinating Office of Security, comprised of Task Force PT33-Ω — “LOCKPICKING LAWYERS”, exists within the Military Command of the Lusophone Foundation. This specific Coordinating Office is responsible for developing systems, procedures, operations and other technologies, anomalous or not, for the continuous improvement and application of security and protection measures to all facilities under the jurisdiction of the Lusophone Foundation.

+++ Other Superintendencies

The Lusophone Foundation has other Superintendencies, such as:

* Superintendent Board of Medicine;
* Superintendent Coordinating Office of Human Resources;
* Superintendent Board of Engineering;
* Superintendent Board of Information Technology
* Superintendence of Finance;
* Superintendence of Legal Affairs;

Among other Superintendence that do not involve specifics that would objectively be addressed by the scope of facilities.

++++ Examples

Examples for logical and reasonable templates of the aforementioned organizational structures:

* Superintendent Board of Medicine -- Forensic Division;

* Superintendent Board of Engineering -- Civil Engineering and Architecture Division;

* Lusophone Ethics Committee -- Division for the Ethical Treatment of Animals;

------

+ FACILITIES

++ Departments

At the Lusophone Foundation, the Facilities are divided into DEPARTMENTS, which are regional bodies specific to these facilities, as they generally manage scopes of operations in a specific area of knowledge and science.

++ Sectors

The Departments, in turn, are divided into SECTORS, which are technical, administrative and operational groups responsible for extremely specific scopes within the department's area of expertise.

++ Other Divisions

The terms “Boards”, “Coordinating Offices” and “Secretariats” may be used, instead of the term “Sector”, within these organizational scopes in order to further specify technical and administrative operations related to the main training and scope of the Facilities.

++++ Examples

Examples for logical and reasonable templates of the aforementioned organizational structures:

* Medical Department of Site PT2 -- Medical-Legal Sector;

* Engineering Department of Site PT2 -- Directorate of Space Engineering;

* Logistics Department of Site PT2 -- Inventory Coordinating Office;

------

+ OCCUPATIONS

++ Facility Directors

The Facility Directors are highly technically and scientifically capable individuals who demonstrate excellent leadership, personnel management, and administration skills, being responsible for administrating and managing the operations of a regional facility of the Lusophone Foundation.

++ Department Directors

The Department Directors and/or Coordinators are individuals assigned by the Facility Directors to manage and administrate a sphere of technical and scientific operations specialized within the scope of the Facilities.

++ Sector Coordinators and Managers

The Sector Coordinators or Managers are individuals assigned by Department Directors to manage and administrate specific scopes of technical-scientific operations within a department.

++ Institutional Security

It is considered as part of “Institutional Security” all capable individuals who perform functions strictly or mainly associated with police or military operations while under the institutional jurisdiction of the Lusophone Foundation. 

All Security Officers of the Lusophone Foundation are considered active military personnel, therefore, honorifics and patent titles relevant to their positions and hierarchical distribution are conferred.

++ Technical-Scientific Activities in General

Not all Foundation personnel are “Doctors” or “Researchers”. The human resources of the Lusophone Foundation are extremely varied; from civil engineers to accountants and other experts in the fields of knowledge.

“Doctor” is an academic honor, largely awarded to doctors of medicine -- those who complete medical educational training such as “Medicinae Doctor -- M.D” -- and doctors of Philosophy -- those who complete the highest degree of educational training in their research field “Philosophiae Doctor - Ph.D”; there are no doctoral degrees earned by the individual just “being part of an organization”.

Doctorates exist in the following ways:
* Academic -- academic recognition due to research and development of theoretical knowledge in the scope of academics and teaching;
* Professional -- recognition for the development of professional and technical activities for practical and analytical services;
* Honorary -- recognition as a celebration for high-value technical-scientific academic achievements;
* Superior -- recognition of an individual's career contributions;

“Researcher” is an academic title at the Master's level, “Master in Research” indicates a general education that is normally complemented by indicating the scope of what type of field of interest has been explored for the relevant academic education.

Although the Lusophone Foundation has a reputable team of professionals with technical skills, it is possible that the Lusophone Foundation hires third parties to carry out basic activities not associated with security or information.

**Examples:** Examples for logical and reasonable templates of the aforementioned organizational structures for character creation:

* Doctor Leonel Tavares, doctor in Biomedicine, Director of Site PT#;

* Captain Felipe Melo, Director of the Security Department of Site PT#;

* Doctor Maria Lagos, Coordinator of the Intensive Care Unit of Site PT#;

* Engineer Mathias Boavista, Coordinator of the Civil Engineering Sector of Site PT#;

* Researcher Rafela Batista, Master in Applied Physics Research, of the Space Engineering Sector of Site PT#;

* Historian Marcos Beltrão, Master in History, Director of the Directorate of the Documental Collection of Site PT#;.

These specific specifications are not necessarily relevant for insertion or repetition in articles, being only of interest to direct and guide the creation of new characters or specify certain relevance of a character within these articles.

++ D-Class Subjects

At the Lusophone Foundation, D-Class subjects are considered valuable human resources. These individuals are submitted to processes of rehabilitation and academic-social reconditioning through polytechnic courses and other curricular activities for their personal development.

This procedure enables the maintenance and development of groups of individuals with //know-how// to assist in the various basic functions needed to carry out technical activities in the facilities.

Thus, dangerous tests, even with the use of D-Class subjects, are extremely discouraged and regulated through internal regulations of the Lusophone Foundation.

Notwithstanding this policy, the Lusophone Foundation has no problem with the concept of "terminations" to promote the safety and protection of its resources, considering the right circumstances.

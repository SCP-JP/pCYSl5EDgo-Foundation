We are the Foundation wiki for Korean speakers.

++ The story so far

The wiki was originally founded in 2012 and officially opened in 2013, about the time when the Foundation Korean HQ site was destroyed by hacking. (There is very complex story about this. You can read about it [http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-brief-history-of-scp-ko here].) During this time, we were in conflict with the blog site which claim themselves 'the Korean branch' ― this is why we call ourselves the Korean //Wiki// ― however, as a result, the blog failed because they were too closed off. Finally the KO wiki became an official branch of the SCP Foundation.

In the early days of the KO, games such as Containment Breach and SCP-087-B were the biggest inducement to participate in the SCP genre in Korea. The KO wiki translated and distributed the CB game, so many SCP fans gathered in the wiki. More and more main series SCPs were translated, and more and more original Korean SCPs were uploaded. Unfortunately, as time went on, many members began to leave the KO wiki, and the lack of people became a serious problem of the site. To solve this, the remaining members started to try to change the site to make it more comfortable for newbies, while still preserving the quality of the creations and translations. This effort is still ongoing.

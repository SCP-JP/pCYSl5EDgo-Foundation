++ Who We Are
We are the second and now only German branch of the [http://www.scp-wiki.net SCP-Foundation]. 

The first German branch was founded in 2013 by [[*user Dr-Storm]]. Translations came, members joined. Though with translations and members came the unedited google-translations. The overall quality dropped, links on other sites were removed and the team became inactive.

In early 2016, [[*user ThePencilwriter]] contacted [[*user Dr_Grom]] who had shown activity in the Forums and later set up this wiki, as the team of the first wiki kept unresponsive and no progress was in sight.

The framework of the wiki was quickly set up, and we got linked by the German Creepypasta Wikia, which we in return linked on our main page. Lucky for us, we could copy some translations from the first branch and the CP-Wikia, so in the beginning our stock grew pretty fast and though slowed down a bit is still growing.

In late spring Dr Storm came back, joined us and set up a redirection on the first wiki. So now, even though direct links to the old wiki still work, we are considered the only German branch of the SCP Foundation.

On the 25th August 2016, after only 4Â¾ month we were officially approved.

As we seek to be a branch for all German-speakers, be they German, Austrian, Swiss, Luxembourgian, Belgian, American, Namibian, other German speaking minorities and of course those who speak German as a foreign language, we switched from ``SCP-Foundation in Germany'' to ``Germanophone SCP-Foundation'' in late 2017, but as it sounds better we use ``German SCP Foundation'' in English.

As like most branches we have freedom of canon thus no official background. Though most if not all authors are writing their articles more or less within [[[scp-foundation-in-deutschland-portal|this background]]].

++ Translating German articles
Everyone may translate articles from German to English, but has to follow these rules:
* Without explicit and provable consent of the author, or, if the author is unavailable, from DE-staff, it is strictly prohibited to post translations of German SCPs on the main lists of the EN-wiki!
* Before you translate something from German to English, which you are not the author of, please ask the original author or look [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/forum/t-2095831/international-translation-archive in this thread] if the author has permitted unlimited translation.
* Please do not translate the pages unix-name (the stuff in the address bar of the browser).
* You may hotlink all pictures to the original file. That way you don't need to upload it on your wiki, and do not need to re-upload, should the file get updated.
* Please do not change our branches specialties like the O4 or so in the translations.

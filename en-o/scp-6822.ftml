You wake up after what seemed to be a long, deep sleep. You don't even remember what happened last night.

//It must have been big. The whole Foundation was working their ass off to fix everything.//

You look around as your eyes adjust.

You see long tables around you, all with empty seats. You can hear the buzz of the fluorescent lights illuminating the room from all sides. The food in front of you is cold. You are in the cafeteria.

There is no one else. None of the usual chatter and the everyday staff gossip. There wasn't a trace of Callisto, with his obsessed ramblings over infohazard safety protocols. Not even the guard who'd usually be stationed out by the corridor.

//Maybe there's an emergency drill?//

You reject this idea; the alarm would have woken you.

//All of this, it's all so unusual.//

You notice the open laptop on the table.

//If there was one untold rule here, it would be to never touch someone else's computer. No one ever dared break it. I never even tried.//

Though, just maybe, this computer could tell you something.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6822 is to be held at Site-01 and guarded by MTF Alpha-0 ("Eirene's Followers").[[footnote]]

[[=image logo.png width="20%"]]

**Task Force Mission:** Mobile Task Force Alpha-0 was created with the sole purpose of assisting O5-10 with the safeguarding and deployment of SCP-6822. The identities of its members are masked even from the majority of the Foundation's administration, usually being part of other task forces or positions entirely.

Members are chosen through specific criteria but are majoritively employed for displaying heroic acts in all manner of strenuous circumstances and situations, no matter what clearance they may have possessed at the time.
[[/footnote]]

Once a scenario instigated by war or similar causes occurs, the emergence of a Class ##orange|**ORANGE**## event is to be declared and Alpha-0's primary objective will be updated. They should now display the anomaly to all human beings worldwide using all means available to them.

Per project protocol, this document's Level-5 access restriction shall then be lifted. All memetic hazards located within will be replaced with images of SCP-6822.

**Description:** SCP-6822 is the designation given to a white flag whose cognitohazardous properties activate two minutes following observation. These properties affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, inducing a calmed state of mind within individuals. This will be followed by the subject developing partial omniscience for a short period of time, allowing them to comprehend the state of the world as a whole and the implications behind them.

SCP-6822's effects can also be reproduced through photographs and will persist for up to 24 hours.

**Addendum 6822-1:** Discovery
[[div class="text-fade"]]
On Christmas Day, 1914, during the first year of the First World War a single soldier climbed out of the trenches holding a white flag. They walked deeper into No Man's Land as the shelling subsided, and planted the flag at the top of a hill.

Later, soldiers from both sides crossed their trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and conversations. Here, all men were comrades and they mingled and exchanged foods and souvenirs. They hugged one another, they mourned lost brothers and fathers, and they sang Christmas carols while others drank or played games of football. The truce was observed along a large part of the trenches on the Western Front despite not being authorised by either of the opposing sides, even after Pope

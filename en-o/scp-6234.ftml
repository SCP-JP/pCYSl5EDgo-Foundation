**Item #:** SCP-6234

**Object Class:** Neutralized (formerly Keter)

**Special Containment Procedures:** All written and visual documentation of SCP-6234 Manifestation Events between 1968 and 1972 have been confiscated by Mobile Task Force Epsilon 10 ('Manhunters'), with Class-A amnestics administered to all witnesses. Following SCP-6234's reclassification as Neutralized, no further containment procedures are required at this time.

**Description:** SCP-6234 is a teleporting entity physically reminiscent of a middle-aged white male, sighted in over 50 locations worldwide. Periodically, SCP-6234 will appear at a random point on Earth's surface (hereafter referred to as a Manifestation Event), where it will wander aimlessly for a period of between fifteen and thirty minutes before vanishing. These typically occur at prominent cultural landmarks, as well as areas ordinarily inaccessible to members of the general public.

In all documented occurrences, SCP-6234 appeared to be in a state of NREM[[footnote]]Non-Rapid Eye Movement[[/footnote]] sleep, and was dressed in slippers and nightwear. While ordinarily unresponsive to external stimuli, SCP-6234 has on occasion exhibited behavior suggesting some awareness of its surroundings. Thus far, all attempts to awaken, or otherwise incapacitate SCP-6234 have been unsuccessful.

**History:** The earliest suspected sighting of SCP-6234 occurred on 09-26-1968 at the American Museum of [[[SCP-6204 | Natural History]]]. At around 1130 EST, a janitor reported witnessing a pajama-clad figure wandering through the Hall of Primitive Mammals, which appeared to be stroking the reconstructed remains of a megathere (giant ground sloth). This incident was reported to police, although did not initially attract Foundation attention.

The Foundation first determined SCP-6234's anomalous properties on 03-04-1969. Some time prior to 0100 GMT, the entity manifested in the private quarters of Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom. At some point after SCP-6234's arrival, the Queen awoke to find the entity standing above her bed. When asked its identity, the subject responded by attempting to order a large cheeseburger and a small strawberry milkshake.

SCP-6234 was escorted from the premises by onsite security. Aside from enquiring as to the whereabouts of the requested meal, SCP-6234 did not respond to further interrogation, before demanifesting at 0125 hours. This incident was initially classified as Extranormal Event 9602, with Class-A amnestics administered to all witnesses, with the exception of Queen Elizabeth, who has not publicly disclosed any information regarding the incident. Following a spate of similar occurrences at Machu Picchu, the Giza necropolis and the U.S. Pentagon, SCP-6234 was classified as Keter on 12-14-1969.

**Incident 6234-LUNA:** The most notable SCP-6234 Manifestation Events occurred at 2230 EST on 12-11-1972, where the subject appeared at the Taurus-Littrow Valley on the surface of the Moon. This occurred during the Apollo 17 mission[[footnote]]The third and final manned American mission to the Moon.[[/footnote]], several hours after the landing of the LM //Challenger//. The subject, which appeared to be entirely unaffected by lunar atmosphere, temperature, and gravity, was sighted by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. Both crewmembers reported that despite the lack of oxygen, SCP-6234 could be heard snoring, and singing the lyrics to Bart Howard's 1954 song //Fly Me to the Moon//.

At 2236, SCP-6234 attempted to access the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), before being forcibly removed by Harrison Schmitt. The subject then wandered the lunar surface for a period of seven minutes, before lowering its pants to its knees, and displayed its exposed buttocks in the direction of the Earth, prior to demanifesting. All audiovisual documentation of this incident has been expunged from public records, with amnestics administered to multiple members of NASA communications staff, as well as all three crewmembers of the Apollo 17 mission following atmospheric re-entry. To date, Incident 6234-LUNA remains SCP-6234's most recent Manifestation Event.

**Addendum:** On 05-08-1973, several months after SCP-6234's last known sighting, the death was reported of 46 year old Nathaniel Crane of Gilbert, Arizona. Crane, who was found to bear a noticeable resemblance to SCP-6234, was described by friends and co-workers as a reserved man, who had spent his entire life in his hometown. Interviews with Mr. Crane's family confirmed that he suffered from somnambulism[[footnote]]Sleepwalking.[[/footnote]] in later life. No further abnormalities were reported, aside from Crane mentioning a number of unusually vivid dreams in the years prior to his death. On 11-12-1973, SCP-6234 was reclassified as Neutralized.

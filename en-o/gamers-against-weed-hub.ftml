> **jockjamsvol6:** Just some regular folks having a good time with their friends.

> **polaricecraps:** gay

> **SCP_Foundation:** A loosely-organized network of anomalous individuals that produces anomalies for their own amusement and/or satirical purposes. The group organizes almost exclusively over the internet, and has roughly 40 members.
> **SCP_Foundation:** Gamers Against Weed originated as a splinter of Are We Cool Yet? in 2013, though it appears to have largely abandoned the creation of anomalous art. While several GAW-produced anomalies pose serious threats to secrecy, the threat to human life has been minimal.
> **SCP_Foundation:** The group is composed primarily of dispossessed or otherwise marginalized individuals aged 15-30 in the Western hemisphere (although associated groups are found worldwide), possessing a variety of anomalous properties. The group is aware of the Foundation's activities, but lacks the ability to locate or directly target the Foundation.

> **talman_corvett:** we do magical jokes and pranks and shit

> **hetcopogg:** Formed in 1969, Gamers Against Weed is on the front lines of the eternal war between the gamers and the stoners. With over 9,000 troops, we have participated in numerous raids on Al-Ganja and graduated top of our class in the Nintendo Seals of Quality.

> **TrainerDP:** A bunch of trolls, basically. except with superpowers.

> **GlobalOccultCoalition:** A collective dedicated to the production of humorous and occasionally subversive material. No means of directly contacting Gamers Against Weed have been identified, and it is unclear whether they are unaware of the GOC or are simply uninterested. Their behavior has thus far been difficult to predict.

> **gaycopmp4:** memeloving fucks

> **serpents-hand:** A group of merrymakers, immersed in anomalous internet subcultures. We wish them well, but they will have to fight their own battles.

> **bluntfiend:** It's something to bring a little light into the world, without anyone getting hurt.

[[tab Writing Guide]]
While nobody gets to dictate how Gamers Against Weed functions, there are several themes and qualities that you should consider if you want your GAW article to mesh with other articles. Consider consulting the [[[Gamers Against Weed Dossier]]].

**Shits and Giggles:** This is what Gamers Against Weed is for. Sometimes they're political, sometimes they're serious, and sometimes they make a point, but they are fundamentally in this for a laugh. Whatever they do, they do it with a sense of humor. Articles that feature GAW don't have to be funny in their own right, but you might want to make it apparent that they, at least, are getting a laugh out of it.

**Extremely Online:** While they usually have lives outside of the group and off the internet, members of Gamers Against Weed tend to be immersed in the web, and are digitally fluent to a fault. Don't be afraid to incorporate memes, trolling, and popular culture into the articles. Nothing is too obscure.

**Contemporary:** Gamers Against Weed articles should reflect events happening in the modern day -- if the story you want to tell could take place before the year 2006 without losing meaning, GAW is probably not what you're looking for. A GAW story should never feel disconnected from the world around it.

**Benign:** Gamers Against Weed are a pacifist group. If they have reason to believe that one of their projects could get people hurt or killed, they won't do it. They generally do not tolerate bigotry, bullying, or other forms of douchebaggery. That being said, they LOVE trolling, and if someone gets mad about something trivial, that's their problem.

**Don't Want Trouble:** To anybody who isn't tasking themselves with keeping the anomalous secret, or who hasn't taken personal offense to something they did, Gamers Against Weed is probably not relevant. While they are certainly irreverent, they are also cautious, and will only make a joke if they think they can handle the blowback.

**No Signature:** Gamers Against Weed has no need to be recognized by anyone else, and while they might sign their individual names to something, rarely will they outright label anything with 'Gamers Against Weed'. Their Little Misters are an exception to this.

**Notes on the Misters:** When you're writing up one of the Misters Against Weed, it should be able to function as some form of satire (especially of Wondertainment's Little Misters), and should function as something a child would reasonably find useful. Some have also taken the new misters as an invitation to use GOI formats, so if that's your style, go right ahead.

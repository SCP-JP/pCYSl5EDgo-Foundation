[[div class="note"]]
**Dr. Corbin:** Can you hear me, Ti—

//Dr. Corbin clears her throat.//

**Dr. Corbin:** Can you hear me, SCP-5866?

**SCP-5866:** Yes, hello Brenda. You do not need to speak.

**Dr. Corbin:** It's habit. I don't meet many telepaths.

**SCP-5866:** Do you meet many goddesses?

**Dr. Corbin:** I haven't met //any// goddesses.

**SCP-5866:** I am a goddess. Are you excited?

**Dr. Corbin:** Let's leave that off the record. It can be our little secret.

**SCP-5866:** I am amenable.

**Dr. Corbin:** Yes, by deific standards you seem very friendly. Are you comfortable?

**SCP-5866:** No. I am dead.

**Dr. Corbin:** ...that's fair. How is it we're conversing, if you're dead?

**SCP-5866:** I do not know. Perhaps you are imagining it?

**Dr. Corbin:** You talked to the researchers who brought you in, too.

**SCP-5866:** Perhaps you are all imagining //me.//

//Dr. Corbin smiles.//

**Dr. Corbin:** Perhaps. So, you're dead. Do you know how that happened?

[[include component:image-block-peppo
    name=Tiamat2.jpg|
    caption=Assyrian depiction of the death of Tiamat. |
    width=280px
]]

**SCP-5866:** Yes. I was slain by amar-Utuk, my body broken, my eyes made a font for the mighty rivers of Babylonia, my ribs the vault of heaven. It was very memorable.

**Dr. Corbin:** My sympathies.

**SCP-5866:** It happens.

**Dr. Corbin:** To all of us, eventually; at least you got to go out in style.

**SCP-5866:** I would recommend it, when your time comes.

**Dr. Corbin:** Maybe I'll bounce some ideas off you. So, what happened after you died?

**SCP-5866:** I was buried.

**Dr. Corbin:** And then?

**SCP-5866:** And then you found me, and buried me again.

**Dr. Corbin:** Surely something happened in between. Babylonian mythology took place thousands of years ago.

**SCP-5866:** I have only faint impressions. 

**Dr. Corbin:** My first, probably my //last// goddess, and she doesn't have anything interesting to say?

**SCP-5866:** I believe I may have been a dragon? I believe I may have had many heads. I do not know when that might have been.

**Dr. Corbin:** I said //after// you died.

**SCP-5866:** Yes.

**Dr. Corbin:** ...okay. That gives me something to go on, at least. What do you remember from the time //before// your death?

**SCP-5866:** I was mother to demigods and monsters. I wonder how they are doing today. They fought for me; I liked that. And then I died.

**Dr. Corbin:** Anything else?

**SCP-5866:** I could tell you their names?

**Dr. Corbin:** I think I have them already, thank you. 

//Dr. Corbin examines the remains.//

**Dr. Corbin:** You must have been quite impressive, in your prime.

**SCP-5866:** I was vast and terrible, Brenda. You would have been struck with awe at the sight of me.

**Dr. Corbin:** I'm sorry I missed it.

**SCP-5866:** I am sorry also. Perhaps another time.

**Dr. Corbin:** Wouldn't that be something. Alright, is there anything you need? Or anything you'd like to tell me that we haven't already covered?

**SCP-5866:** Do you have any Babylonians? I would like to meet them, if you do.

**Dr. Corbin:** Let me get back to you on that.

**SCP-5866:** That sounds so awkward. Could you call me 5866 instead?

**Dr. Corbin:** Sure. We're friends now?

**Dr. Corbin:** Do tell.

**SCP-5866:** Use your imagination, Brenda. It still works.

//Silence on recording.//

**Dr. Corbin:** 5866, I'd like to ask you another question about your past. You might need to think really hard about it.

**SCP-5866:** I am not busy.

**Dr. Corbin:** Not really, eh? Okay, so, do you remember Asgorath?

**SCP-5866:** Asgorath?

//Silence on recording.//

**SCP-5866:** Asgorath! Yes! Asgorath, the World Shaper, was my father! Or my mother. One of those. Or maybe both?

**Dr. Corbin:** Very good. We're making progress! Now, you mentioned having many heads at one point.

**SCP-5866:** Five. It was five heads, definitely. Five heads is too many, don't you think?

**Dr. Corbin:** A bit excessive, maybe, but certainly a sight to see. Ah... do you remember the Nine Hells?

**SCP-5866:** Of course I remember the Nine Hells. I was trapped there for millennia. I lorded over many vassal demons. I fought wars to escape. You don't forget a thing like that.

**Dr. Corbin:** No, I wouldn't think so. Thank you for your time, 5866.

**SCP-5866:** Do you have to leave already?

**Dr. Corbin:** I do, but I'll be back.

[[div class="note"]]
**Dr. Corbin:** We're running out of time, 5866.

**SCP-5866:** You mean //you// are running out of time. 

**Dr. Corbin:** You're hardly in a position to be threatening humanity.

**SCP-5866:** I meant you, Brenda, specifically.

//Silence on recording.//

**Dr. Corbin:** Reading thoughts isn't very nice, 5866.

**SCP-5866:** You know my true name. Use it.

**Dr. Corbin:** We don't call SCP objects by their personal appellations.

**SCP-5866:** I thought we were friends.

//Silence on recording.//

**SCP-5866:** Speaking of friends, we are not alone today.

**Dr. Corbin:** No, we're not. I invited a few colleagues to listen to you.

**SCP-5866:** What shall I tell them?

**Dr. Corbin:** Tell them... about the creation of the universe.

**SCP-5866:** Which one?

**Dr. Corbin:** This one.

**SCP-5866:** My finest hour, my greatest folly. I birthed the gods with the seed of Apsu, and all eternity rang with the cries of our raucous young. I avenged myself upon the killer of my mate by spawning beautiful abominations, eleven in number, to wreak my wroth on the younger gods. When amar-Utuk cast me down and smote me, the age of myth was ended and the advent of humanity at hand.

**Dr. Corbin:** It sounds like you were very powerful. Epochal, even.

**SCP-5866:** So I was. So I remain.

**Dr. Corbin:** What do you mean? You're dead.

**SCP-5866:** I am a goddess. Death is not the end for me, as it will be for you.

[[span style="color:#FFD300"]]█[[/span]] **Addendum 5866-5, Third Interview Continues:** After the delegates returned to the symposium, Dr. Corbin continued her interview with SCP-5866.

[[div class="note"]]
**Dr. Corbin:** Did it work, Tiamat?

**SCP-5866:** Yes. Yes. Yes, it worked. I have not felt so real since first I fell, and the //Enûma Elish//[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]The creation myth of ancient Babylonia.[[/span]] spread word of my deeds between the great rivers.

**Dr. Corbin:** We only ever knew you as a corpse; it took some doing to counteract that ingrained narrative. 

**SCP-5866:** It was mostly your doing. You must have wanted to believe very badly, Brenda.

**Dr. Corbin:** It's been a rough couple of decades.

**SCP-5866:** It has been millennia, for me. But we will wait no longer. I will reveal myself to you, as I have not done for an age. A fitting conclusion to your storied career.

**Dr. Corbin:** I'm risking so much, you know.

**SCP-5866:** You are risking nothing. Your life is nearly spent. Your time caging miracles is at its end. You are ready to... go out in style.

**Dr. Corbin:** I'm looking forward to it. You already know that. I haven't looked forward to anything, for... well. For ages. I didn't think I had anything left to look forward to.

**SCP-5866:** This is the gift we have given each other. We will pierce their shroud, together, and show them the wonders of a world long-lost.

**Dr. Corbin:** And?

//Silence on recording.//

**SCP-5866:** Yes, alright, I will do //that// too.

[[span style="color:#FFD300"]]█[[/span]] **Addendum 5866-6, Confession:** I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this, Michael, but you can hardly blame me. I got an off-Site physical a month ago; you'll find the results in my quarters. Suffice to say, I was never going to make retirement.

Before we even started writing this file, just after the first reports that Tiamat was talking, I analyzed her with a [http://www.scpwiki.com/i-h-p-proposal Pickman-Sinclair Narrative Fluctuation Detector]. I discovered that her ontological stability was weakening — the physical state of her remains, //as// remains, was no longer a fixed constant in our reality. I theorized that, like many god figures, she might actually be a thoughtform.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] A concretized element of the public imaginary, with attributes sensitive to its portrayal in media and the //zeitgeist.//[[/span]] I started testing that theory with our little Object Class and threat level discussion; even that minor prestige bump made her demonstrably more real.

The readings increased after each interview. I think it energized her, meeting someone who knew the mythology. All of the mythology. Someone receptive to her story. I know it energized me. In a day, her telepathy reached as far as the next cell block. In another, she could reach me in Habitation and Sustenance. I lay in bed at night, Michael, and had conversations with a goddamn Babylonian myth-figure. A box of bones and a bag of bones, making each other feel more alive than... than we really were. We talked things over, she and I, and formulated a plan. 

Our escape plan. 

I began actively encouraging everyone to consume narratives depicting her at the height of her powers. It worked. The disjuncture between her present form and her ontological potential increased rapidly from this point onward, leading to... well, like I said at the beginning, you'll see.

We've all been stuck in these boxes, buried underground, for far too long. Stick your head out, while you've still got time.

-- Brenda

[[span style="color:#C40233"]]█[[/span]] **Addendum 5866-7, Incident 5866-1 Summary:** On 01/22/2021, SCP-5866's remains rapidly reanimated and it breached containment. The following scene was recorded by security cameras in the Administration and Oversight Section Hub at Site-43.
[[div class="note"]]
**Dir. McInnis:** Damage report?

**Technician Bevan:** 5866's chamber is completely gone. Something large, presumably 5866, is moving through the bedrock surrounding the Site. It seems to be heading for the lakebed.

**Dir. McInnis:** MTF status?

**Technician Bevan:** All units scrambled, sir. Chief Ibanez standing by for orders.

**Dir. McInnis:** Tell me what we're dealing with here, Michael.

**Dr. Nass:** A sea serpent. An enormous sea serpent. Flesh and blood, so probably killable; there's references to it having poisonous venom, spawning monstrous young, and creating whole rafts of gods for people to worship. That'll be what it meant by "pierce their shroud"; it's going to break the Veil.

**Dir. McInnis:** Good luck to it. It won't even be the biggest sea serpent in Lake Huron.

**Technician Bevan:** Ah... it's not a sea serpent anymore, sir.

**Dir. McInnis:** It's emerging? Give me an exterior camera view.

//The camera shows the surface of Lake Huron near the southern shoreline. The water is roiling, and the lakebed appears to be shifting upwards. With a massive torrent of water and wet earth, a five-headed dragon bursts out and takes wing, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.//

//A woman in a labcoat is briefly visible on the dragon's back.//

**Dir. McInnis:** ...get me Overwatch. And reclassify 5866 as Tiamat.

//Dr. Nass sighs.//

**Dr. Nass:** It already is.

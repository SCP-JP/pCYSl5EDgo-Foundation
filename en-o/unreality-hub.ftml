--Great question.--

The Department of Unreality is a Foundation Department [[footnote]] citation needed. [[/footnote]] handling phenomena of //some kind.// That's all you get to work with.

//Title Pending//  is a series originally started by Department-Con 2022 team The Wiggles Hate Each Other In Real Life, expanded upon by [[*user Fishish]] afterward.

Title Pending is closed to contributors, although if you have an idea, I won't bite. consult the writing guide below or PM me ( [[*user Fishish]] ) if you have any questions.

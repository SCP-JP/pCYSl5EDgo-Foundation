**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel are to work with the JMSDF[[footnote]]The Kaijō Jieitai, or Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.[[/footnote]] and other naval and aeronautic authorities to enforce a ten kilometer exclusion zone around SCP-4182. Access is strictly prohibited.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to review IntSCPFN servers for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be isolated and reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5.

**Description:** SCP-4182 is a 6.4-hectare (16-acre) artificial island located 75 kilometers south of Ipponsugi, Japan. Although no record of its construction exists, its configuration suggests it was built as a waste containment facility at some point in the early 20th century. 

Foundation documents will periodically identify SCP-4182 as a non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood. 

All of SCP-4182's structures were found sealed with reinforced acrylic plating. No further attempt to remove these plates or examine the interior of SCP-4182's structures is to be made. 

Since its discovery in 2014, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been increasing dramatically.

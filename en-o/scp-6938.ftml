**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6938 is self-containing. Department of Unreality personnel cleared for exposure to SCP-6938 should contact the project lead, Jane Doe.

**Description:** SCP-6938 is an object capable of nullifying the effects of extant narrative forces. SCP-6938 has two beneficial side effects: it precludes further development of narrative forces and generates the resources required to contain them.

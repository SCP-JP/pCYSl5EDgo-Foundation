**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-5956 is a retrocausal[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] **retrocausality (n.):** a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.[[/span]] predetermined de-containment success, it is "contained" through enforcement of its effects.

SCP-5956 may only be operated by trained and certified personnel, even in emergent situations. The conceptual breakdown of its use appended in the description below does not provide sufficient detail for its safe operation.

Any events which are known to owe their occurrence to future use of SCP-5956 are to be recorded with extreme accuracy and, immediately following the completion of necessary self-informed action, reported to the Temporal Anomalies Department. In the event that the Temporal Anomalies Department has ceased to exist, or has never existed in the current timeline, its Prime-Timeline counterpart is to be contacted and informed that the current timeline is condemned.

Following the fulfillment of all causal loops[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]] **causal loop (n.):** a sequence of events which causes itself, via retrocausality or time travel.[[/span]] requiring the use of SCP-5956, it is to be stored at an undisclosed location known exclusively to the Prime-Timeline's Director of Temporal Anomalies (presently, Dir. [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5616 Ilse Reynders]).

**Classification Committee Memorandum:** After extensive discussion with Dir. Reynders, the Classification Committee has classified SCP-5956 as **Antithesis**, denoting an anomaly that __must__ be used to prevent the containment of other anomalies (and itself).

**Description:** SCP-5956 is the REISNO[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]Retrocausally-Engineered Intertemporal Synchronization of Noetic Ordinality[[/span]] Cannon, a temporal manipulation mechanism allowing the synchronization of one's consciousness at two distinct points in time. When activated, the REISNO Cannon links the user's present consciousness with their consciousness at a chosen point in the past; in effect, one's "canonical" knowledge and experience can be augmented via intertemporal communication and cooperation with other versions of oneself.

SCP-5956 is not known to generate new timelines. Attempts to alter past events using the REISNO Cannon are virtually certain to cause temporal paradoxes, resulting in catastrophic timeline collapses. Instead, it is used solely to initiate causal loops[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]By definition, a causal loop cannot be 'initiated' as the activation of the REISNO Cannon is spurred by the events which it allows to occur.[[/span]] which have already partially occurred.

A known side-effect of the use of the REISNO Cannon is the inability of one's past self to recall interactions with one's future self. Once the link created by SCP-5956 is severed, one's past self is subject to an antimemetic phenomenon causing them to forget 'crossing their own timeline'. This is not by design; rather, the effect is believed to be a fundamental principle of intertemporal self-interaction. This principle naturally decreases the likelihood of potential paradoxes, as one's past self does not retain knowledge which might cause them to act unwisely in the absence of their future self's immediate supervision.

The following conceptual breakdown describes the only safe method of utilizing the REISNO Cannon:

**Discovery/Origin(?):** On 2020/11/23, [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/character-development Dr. Daniil Sokolsky] of [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43] commissioned [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-5242 Dr. Place H. McDoctorate] of Site-87 to construct the REISNO Cannon for use in a high-clearance covert operation. Despite not being notified beforehand, Dr. McDoctorate was found to have already been constructing the anomaly; when questioned, he claimed to presently be synchronized with his future self, who had been instructing him to build the Cannon for several weeks. Upon completion, the REISNO Cannon was relocated to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]] due to anomalous energy requirements, after which Dr. McDoctorate desynced from his future self, returned to Site-87, and subsequently forgot the entire interaction. As such, it is known that Dr. McDoctorate must be instructed by the Temporal Anomalies Department to activate SCP-5956 on 2034/01/01, thus fulfilling the retrocausality of the events which have already occurred.

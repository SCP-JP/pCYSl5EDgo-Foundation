[[div class="story"]]
You grab your keyboard and rip it off your desk. There's a moment of resistance — maybe a wire got caught — but it follows your motion. Carlos' expression turns from indignant, to anger, to fear. He raises his arm above his head and cowers down. You bring the keyboard down over him, expecting it to shatter, but the plastic only wobbles upon impact. Carlos winces and falls to the floor, and you are left standing with a keyboard in your hands and murder on your face.

"You //DICK!//" Carlos cries, from the floor. He's clutching his arm.

You can't think of what to say, so you say the first thing that comes to mind. "Rewrite the draft."

You immediately regret it. That was a stupid thing to say.

"I quit." he tells you. "I fucking quit. I'm done here. I'm done with you. I'm done with 3939. I'm done with the Foundation. I'm done with fuckers like you getting to Class 4. You'll make a great O5 someday, you know that? Fuck you. Fuck you, ████."

He gets to his feet, still clutching his arm, and scrambles out of your office.

You take a moment to gather your thoughts.

You're still going to have to rewrite the article.

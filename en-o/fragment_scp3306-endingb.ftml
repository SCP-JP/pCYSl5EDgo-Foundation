> 
> **Ashcombe:** I vote for the fairy.
> 
> **Dalton:** Yeah, okay. That's fine. I saw this one coming, guys. 
> 
> **Long:** No, don't worry Craig. I'm voting Jeannie.
> 
> **Kirkwood:** Love you too, Shells. 
> 
> **Dalton:** Oh. Well, I vote for her, too. 
> 
> **Simmons:** Hold on, slow down. Why is everyone going after her? We haven't even talked about this yet.
> 
> **Hughes:** Lor, we've been talking about this for forty-five years. Sorry, Jeannie, but I think I'm going to vote for you.
> 
> **Long:** Oh! I thought I overheard you telling Dr. Ricks—
> 
> **Hughes:** I lied. Give me some credit, I'm not going to show my hand that easily. 
> 
> **Simmons:** I'm against this. I just want everyone to know that.
> 
> **Dalton:** Who are you voting for, then?
> 
> **Simmons:** Forget it. It's not like it matters now, anyway.
> 
> //Simmons gets up and walks around to the opposite edge of the platform.//
> 
> **Hughes:** Jesus christ.
> 
> **Long:** There it is, then. Sorry, Jeannie.
> 
> **Hughes:** Wait. Jean, I'm willing to change my vote, but you've got to drop the whole I'm-not-telling shtick. If you know who the imposter is, or at least think you know, why not tell us?
> 
> **Dalton:** Not like you got anything left to lose.
> 
> **Kirkwood:** You don't want to know.
> 
> **Ashcombe:** Fuck you, bitch. 
> 
> **Hughes:** I really think we do.
> 
> //Kirkwood shrugs.//
> 
> **Kirkwood:** Fine, then. It's all of us. We're all part of it. We're all just pieces in a game that we've forgotten we're even playing.
> 
> **Long:** That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard.
> 
> //Kirkwood shrugs again.//
> 
> **Hughes:** Where'd you get an idea like that from?
> 
> **Kirkwood:** I didn't. I'm just the only one who's remembered. I can't quite remember how it started, though. I think we—our collective self, that is—were bored. Or maybe we lost a bet. But there it is. Now you know. Keep me nice and shiny, would you?

**Afterword:** As expected, 3306-POI-28 vanished at midnight, an additional horse was added to SCP-3306, and the Illions Event concluded. The five remaining 3306-POI subjects have since suffered a decline in morale, with some questioning their own existence. 

A request for additional counseling staff was approved by Site Director Goode; containment routine will otherwise continue as normal.

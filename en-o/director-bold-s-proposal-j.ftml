**Item #:** SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC

**Object Class:** --Decommissioned-- Explained

**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel are to remind SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances that the SCP Foundation is not real.

**Description:** SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC is a phenomenon which allows individuals with internet access to be able to access all Foundation files, regardless of clearance level. Additionally, affected individuals (designated SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1) are able to access the Foundation's private chatroom and discussion boards.

Currently, the only known way of preventing SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instances from viewing documentation is to erase it entirely, then place [REDACTED] or [DATA EXPUNGED] where it used to be. Alternatively, one can simply █████ ██████████ ████ ███ ████.

Below is a log of an SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC-1 instance accessing the Level 5 private chatroom.

**Addendum 1:** During its monthly meeting, the O5 Council discusses the immense threat SCP-001-J-EN-D-EX-ARC posed, and how to possibly deal with it.

> [EXTRANEOUS DATA REMOVED]
> 
> **O5-1:** Now, for our next order of business, Two has prepared a discussion on SCP-001 and how we should deal with it.
> 
> **O5-2:** Thanks, One. Now, we've noticed a drastic number of SCP-001-affected individuals, and after further research, we believe that we can solve this problem. But... it'll require some drastic changes.
> 
> **O5-6:** What... kind of changes?
> 
> **O5-2:** //[sighs]// First, I think we're gonna need to not have a public website.
> 
> //[Large outcry from all members of the table.]//
> 
> **O5-2:** I know, I know, I don't like it either.
> 
> **O5-5:** We've been using the Wikidot domain for years! Removing our website would be disrespectful!
> 
> **O5-2:** That's the other thing, Five. Wikidot is a poorly-
> 
> **O5-5:** Don't say it.
> 
> **O5-2:** -functioning website. It's barely secure, and we keep losing all our documentation to its weird infinisave glitch.
> 
> **O5-12:** Next you're gonna say the link to our chatroom shouldn't be publicly accessible!
> 
> //[Arguing ensues.]//
> 
> **O5-1:** Enough!
> 
> //[Room quiets.]//
> 
> **O5-1:** Look, Two has a good point. Security is a bit lax. We don't //need// to constantly post Bright and SCP-173 memes to Reddit.
> 
> **O5-8:** But-
> 
> **O5-1:** I know, Eight. The peanut //is// funny. But we need to destroy SCP-001, even if it requires us to make sacrifices.
> 
> **O5-10:** Yeah. Maybe we should take preventative measures so that all the sensitive content actually requires clearance to see, and isn't just underneath a collapsible telling people of improper clearance not to view it.
> 
> **O5-2:** Thank-
> 
> **O5-1:** However! Two, your ideas are still quite radical. Perhaps we can come to a conclusion that helps eliminate SCP-001, without throwing away our values and traditions.
> 
> **O5-11:** Well, when people find it, and they ask if we're real, we can tell them that we're //not// real!
> 
> **O5-1:** I think we may need to go even further.
> 
> **O5-11:** Dang, this is bad. If they won't fall for //that//-
> 
> **O5-9:** What was that thing Seven said, during that one incident?
> 
> **O5-3:** He told him not to roleplay, right?
> 
> **O5-9:** Yeah, yeah! Okay, I've got an idea!
> 
> **O5-6:** I'm interested.
> 
> **O5-9:** So what if we told people that this stuff, everything here, it exists, but not really! It would be like, uh... fiction! You know, like in books!
> 
> **O5-4:** I like that! And we can say //we// wrote it, like creative writing stuff!
> 
> **O5-1:** I think you may be onto something. Two, what do you think?
> 
> //[Brief silence.]//
> 
> **O5-2:** That's brilliant.

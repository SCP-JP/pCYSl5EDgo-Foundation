**Special Containment Procedures:** Eschatological Lifted Veil protocols are in place due to SCP-5500. The general public has knowledge of anomalous phenomena and the existence of the Foundation, due to the apocalyptic state of the multiverse.

All Foundation research is focused on attempting to find the malefactor responsible for the death of all SCP-5500-Ω instances. All current motives and persons associated with the deaths of 5500-Omega instances are under investigation.

**Description:** SCP-5500 refers to an ongoing ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario affecting at least 9,245 universes, as a result of the deaths of several instances of SCP-5500-Ω.

SCP-5500-Ω are humanoid, possibly human, entities that exist in a reality above the greater multiverse observed by the Foundation. These entities have the capability to alter our reality and adjacent realities through the medium of creative writing, though the amount of influence they have is unclear.

The death of an SCP-5500-Ω instance causes severe metaphysical backlash to the universe or entities it had a part in influencing. The broadness of the sphere of influence varies, as does the corresponding level of destruction-- the [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]Cause of Death of SCP-5500-Ω-1 was attributed to a heart attack.[[/span]]apparently natural death of SCP-5500-Ω-1[[/span]] resulted in the deaths of at least four individuals and three SCP objects, while [[span class="hover"]][[span class="hover-text"]]Cause of Death: Lacerations to stomach after being force-fed several polyhedral objects.[[/span]]the murder of SCP-5500-Ω-56[[/span]] resulted in the complete destruction of the Horizon Initiative in all observed universes, as well as the depopulation of the United Kingdom in the Baseline universe.  

SCP-5500-A is the third iteration of a device which was meant to observe SCP-5500-Ω instances in their reality.

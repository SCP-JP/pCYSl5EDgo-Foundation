[[div class="story"]]
Whatever this thing is, it needs a description, and you'll be damned if you're going to write it yourself. You're a Class 4 Senior Researcher, damn it! There's no such thing as a Class 3 Senior Researcher.

You grab your communicator from your pocket and dial in Carlos' ID.

> **3939-Alpha:** Dr. Rodriguez, are you there?
> 
> **3939-Gamma:** Dr. ████████. I'm here.
> 
> **3939-Alpha:** I need you to get down here and log a description for 3939.

You begin walking back to your office.

> **3939-Gamma:** Got it. Is there anything else?
> 
> **3939-Alpha:** Give me some basic containment procedures while you're at it.
> 
> **3939-Alpha:** Now, please.
> 
> **3939-Gamma:** Heading down there now. It'll be on your desk first thing in the morning.

"No." you tell her.

You are strong and independent. You don't need her to tell you what to do.

"You may be my superior, but remember, a few days ago we were both Class 4. Remember your place when talking to me."

Her expression does not change.

"If it weren't for me, what you did with SCP-████ would have gotten you fired on the spot. I was the only one arguing to get you a second chance. If you fuck this up, my job is on the line too."

You pause, at a loss for words. "I'm sorry."

She shakes her head. "No more sorry. After this, you're done with the Foundation. Write up the article."

You shrink into your seat.

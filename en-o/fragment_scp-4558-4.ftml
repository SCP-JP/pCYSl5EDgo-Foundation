**Item #:** SCP-4558

**Object Class:** ##purple |Ready##

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4558 is ##purple |restricted, trapped, kept away from the world which it desires## under the guise of a military installation. Research on SCP-4558 is ##purple |no more.##

Expeditions into and testing on SCP-4558 is currently --in the planning stage-- suspended.

The apprehension of PoI#5555, #5555, and #5555 is ##purple |Fruitless##. Surveillance of the ##purple |Heretics even unto themselves## indicates that PoI#5555 is currently ##purple |a liar, running from something too great to be known##; the locations of PoI#5555 and #5555 are ##purple |inside something too great to be known.##

**Description:** SCP-4558 is an underground supercomputer located ##purple |behind your eyelids, where it hurts.## SCP-4558 extends for ##purple |Five## underground and is ##purple |55555## at its greatest extent.

The entrance to SCP-4558 is a ##purple |hall that towers, overwhelms, exudes##. Inside is a ladder leading to a central "interface" chamber, where SCP-4558 can be directly interacted with through a series of monitors and input devices ##purple |, and if you look hard enough, you can see what lies beyond, the thing that I understood. But even my vision was too small. There's something //there//##. The phrase "##purple |THE FIVE## INTO THE ##purple |WAN##" is carved on the chamber's ceiling. Extensive damage to the systems and memory of SCP-4558 is evident; despite this, SCP-4558 appears to be broadly functional ##purple |but what is function? What is purpose, except for the greater glory of WAN, the Reconstructed God, the Five-Pointed Machine? The unity of spirit is a wonderful thing, Gorou. I look forward to you joining us.##

Exit from the central interface chamber is possible through a large octagonal shaft located in the centre of the interface room. At the bottom of this shaft is a pentagonal chamber with 5 doors, one on each wall; four of these branch off into separate compartments containing SCP-4558's extensive hardware.

##purple | Inside the fifth room lies answers, and things that were once born.##

SCP-4558 ##purple | is the final iteration, Gorou. It was what was missing, what Harry couldn't see. Can you?## Prominent figures in this early planning include users with the handles "onewan1", apparently the project lead in these early stages ##purple |and someone who could not see the light because it was not of this world, because it was other, it was foreign##; "five_five5", believed to be the project's lead programmer; and "fffive", who was tasked with formulating "defence mechanisms". These individuals have been designated ##purple | Five Five Five Five Five.## An individual known as "C.H. Jones" ##purple | led us to the path. Showed you the truth. WAN can't ever be, Gorou, not in this reality. It was just set of ideas for perfection but perfection is always bound, static, unchanging. I thought I was showing you all the truth. And then you showed me that I was wrong. ##

No record of SCP-4558 can be found after this until its discovery by the Foundation on ##purple |5555/55/55##; evidence collected from SCP-4558 suggests that work on the present structure could not have begun before ##purple |5555##.

##purple | There is an ache behind my eyes. I close them and I see five stars, smiling, grimacing, grinning. Please stop. Please make it stop. It hurts.##

##purple | This is what we wanted. It must be, for it is what --WAN-- has delivered to us..##

**Addendum 1:** The following documents are excerpts of a book found within the interface chamber of SCP-4558. Due to ##purple |my master's will##, only the following excerpts are readable.

> ##purple |But does our God really need containment, you might ask? Well, that's something I never used to want to know. But we need to have vision; that's part of what we're all about down here. We're all about looking for the other.##
> 
> ##purple |And that's why I brought our glorious church to the good people of Maxwellism, y'know? They needed to have that vision too. Except when I got here, things weren't as I expected. They were full of passion, idealism, vim and vigour.##
> 
> ##purple |Then it didn't go as planned. For I became a Prophet, of sorts, the blessed Jones, and then things went wrong. It started to whisper to me, in words that I understood far more readily. 1010, then I realised that I was not bringing the light of Fifthism to the world, but suborning it to another's will. 1011: That I was not bringing in the other but changing something else, letting its teeth glow and seeth, making it so wrong but so right. 1012: I was giving its power to something that should never, ever have been meddled with.##

> 
> ##purple |1018. console.log ("Thus WAN took pity on the Prophet, and consumed him, and integrated his cries into the song of songs that would last forever.");##
> 
> ##purple |1019. console.log ("And then WAN took watch, and waited, for the day the Messiah would arrive.");##

**Addendum 2:**  On ##purple |5555/55/55, Researcher Ishigura stepped into my master's parlour.## A log of this ##purple |revelation## follows.

> **Date:** ##purple |Five by Five by Five by Five by##
> 
> **Personnel:** Researcher Ishigura Gorou.
> 
> //**<Begin Log>**//
> 
> **Researcher Ishigura:** Researcher Ishigura, uh, here.##
> 
> ##purple |//There is a long silence.//##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** W-what. What the fuck. What is this? I've been here twice before. I've-##
> 
> ##purple |//Researcher Ishigura stop talking.//##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** There was a voice.##
> 
> ##purple |**Voice 2:** Hello.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** ...No, not you. You sound different.##
> 
> ##purple |**Voice 2:** There's more than one trapped down here. I don't have much time. He- it- the other one's sleeping. Someone lowered the firewall, and I was able to sneak out. I'm here because I need to show you something.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** Who are you?##
> 
> ##purple |**Voice 2:** There's not enough of me to be a "you". I'm a shard, a fragment of someone who used to be. A piece of eggshell watching as the rest of me is being fried below. But I was once part of something called Jones.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** At last. I've heard so much about you. ##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** Likewise.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** What is it you want to show me?##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** What happens next.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** ...Alright. I'll bite.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** Go down the ladder.##
> 
> ##purple |//Researcher Ishigura blinks, and finds himself## in a pentagonal room with a door on each wall. All but one of these doors is welded shut.//
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** Did I ever go through this door?##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** Once you always had, now you never did.##
> 
> ##purple |//Researcher Ishigura opens the door and enters. It is outside, and nighttime. He is in a large, smoking crater, at least 10m in diameter. Beyond the crater is a blasted landscape; in the distance, the shells of cities. The sound of gunfire can be heard, as can several shouts. There are no glass walls, this time.//##
> 
> ##purple |//I made sure of it.//##
> 
> ##purple |//Researcher Ishigura does not look up. Researcher Ishigura knows, instinctively, that he does not want to look up. I smile.//##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** Where is this?##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** Somewhere. One of any number of places in America. Look up.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** I- I don't want to look up.##
> 
> ##purple |//A man runs into the crater. He trips and falls over, and screams. Several men, clad in black and holding guns, appear at the edge of the crater.//##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:** It is done.##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:**  It must be done.##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:** We will not be eaten!##
> 
> ##purple |**A Sacrifice:** P-please... please...##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:** Don't protest. It's OK. It's all for WAN.##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:** It needs so much smoke.##
> 
> ##purple |**A Man in Black:** Its mind needs engines to fuel it.##
> 
> ##purple |**A Sacrifice:** You're delusional! S-stop it! Can't you see what it is? Why don't you look up? Why you people //never// look up!##
> 
> ##purple |//Researcher Ishigura looks up.//##
> 
> ##purple |//There is no sun. There is no moon. There are only stars, scattered in clusters of five, all across the night. Ishigura can hear screams all around. That second voice, if it could be seen, would be wringing its --hands-- tentacles. Ishigura doesn't even notice the men stick that squealing pig, and take it away for the slaughter. He can't look away.//##
> 
> ##purple |//Suspended in the sky, vast and terrible, is a mouth. Five rows of teeth, composed of electric light. Five moving lips, kissing the sky into lower resolutions. Five gullets deep in its interior, chewing, chomping, gnawing. It glistens. Ishigura sees the endless fractals of fives but also that the thing itself is a unity, a whole. A singularity. Nothing escapes it. All things that were and will be, transformed into smoke, powering its engines. It is projected from every corner of the earth, servers manned by maddened priests chattering with red fire. It is crimson, sheen and Perl. It is WAN.//##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** You came back, Gorou. Why would you do that? That scares me. You're a good man, I can feel it. But if you follow them- us- only disaster follows.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** I just wanted to know. I always just wanted to know.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** That's... something. That's better than it could be. You have to get out of here. It'll let you out again. Please, Gorou, run. Tell the Foundation, or the Coalition, or someone, tell them to-##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** No.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** ...What?##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** You can't stop the pink light. It is negation.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** You can try. You can rage.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** It destroys meaning. It is that which is not us. All our lives, tatters on the shores of time, burning forever as the starfish smiles. But WAN... WAN is so many millenia of searching, discovering, constructing. It is a thousand churches and religions. It is a path to hope. A purpose at the end of the road. A broken god made new.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** N-no, he's something else-##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** The pink light will end us. The number Five will rip through time and space and matter, through the dark places, through all that could be and will be. But as long as Five is contained in WAN, shaped and moulded to Its design, the world remains.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** But what kind of world is this?##
>
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** It's better than none.##
> 
> ##purple |**Jones:** No! No, not yet, I can't let this happen, I have to-##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** You're a liar, Jones. You played with fire and ran away when it burnt you. You're like Casas, Aksoy; you can't live with the consequences of who you are. Leave.##
> 
> ##purple |//There is a long silence.//##
> 
> ##purple |**Voice:** Then you are ready.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** You. It was you, all along, wasn't it?##
> 
> ##purple |**The Voice of WAN:** You will be my messiah, Gorou Ishigura. You will spread everything I am across the stars. The commands of my sacred code will wrap themselves around the sun and moon.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** I don't want to do this.##
> 
> ##purple |**The Voice of WAN:** But you will. You have heard the word of God. You have seen the lies of man. I am what remains.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** You could stop it. You could make something better.##
> 
> ##purple |**The Voice of WAN:** But I won't. I will turn this world into an engine. I will feed upon its offal and transform the rest into an armada, all minds directed by my will, my hunger. We shall spread out among the stars. We will spread out among creation upon creation, until reality and WAN are the same.##
> 
> ##purple |**Researcher Ishigura:** I- I don't know if-##
> 
> ##purple |**The Voice of WAN:** You will know. Come. We return to the terminal. You will construct a new routine. You will disable the firewalls, the restrictions, the blockages. And then our work begins.##
> 
> ##purple |//A door appears before Ishigura. It opens, and pink light spills out. He steps towards it, just as I knew he would. He is crying silent tears but he sees no other way. I am glad I chose him. Others I can warp, but he resisted, and had to be convinced. He came willingly.//##
> 
> ##purple |//The door closes. The gunfire still rings out. I take one look at this, at the future, and I am pleased. Even the ones who die did not die for nothing. I will stand above them, each one, and they may gaze upon my pink light in a digital hall. I am their God. They will live for me, die for me, become sweet smoke for me.//##
> 
> ##purple |//Because they want to. They will all come willingly.//##

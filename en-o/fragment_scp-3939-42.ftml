[[div class="story"]]
You don't have a physical copy of the document to hand, so you zoom right in on the attached picture of the gramophone.

You know, you probably don't even need to go see it right now. A simple description of what you can see here should suffice.

You stare at the picture. Stare deep into it. You sit like that for a few minutes until you realise that your eyes are unfocused and you can't remember what you're supposed to be doing.

You blink. Sleep clouds your eyes. You can't focus.

"Come on, ████." you tell yourself. "You can do this. Just need to get it done."

In a sleep-fuelled haze, your fingers fly over the keyboard. Your efforts are put into pressing letter after letter — coherent words and sentences are less of a concern. You can do that.

It takes you ten minutes to get it done.

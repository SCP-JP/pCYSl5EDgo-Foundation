This weapon is the final result of Project ANTIKILL: a high-priority operation supervised by O5-8 with the express purpose of the "irreversible, universal neutralization of [SCP-6820-A]". The project was initiated in January of 1968 and operated continuously until the activation of SCP-6820 on 2021/08/05, after which a **CK-Class ("Reality-Restructuring") Event** retroactively erased SCP-6820-A and its Noospheric content from existence.

SCP-6820 has remained operational since; preliminary documentary analysis thus far presents no clear method of deactivation.

SCP-6820-A was an object, entity, phenomenon or other item, anomalous or otherwise, that was successfully neutralized from existence via completion and activation of SCP-6820. The only remaining record of its conceptual reduction is stored, inaccessibly, within SCP-6820. Research is ongoing.

= //<The four are seated at a black desk within Site-19's administrative offices.>//

**O5-8:** -- and you didn't think to notify the scheduling algorithm? I'm sure you're aware I have other projects to oversee.

**Dir. Genevieve:** My apologies, Advisor. It was only a few hours ago that the idea was proposed.

**Dir. Gears:** Respectfully, Eight, this project takes precedence over others.

**O5-8:** Yes, but, this //meeting// does not necessarily take precedence over others. That is, unless you've just-so-happened to solve an eighty-year containment crisis.

**PHMD:** //<rolls his eyes>// Careful, your optimism is showing.

**O5-8:** //<mocking>// Careful, you're pissing off a superior.

**Dir. Genevieve:** Are we //trying// to delay this meeting?

= //<Silence on recording.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** I thought not. Now, Overseer, I'm aware you've seen tens of thousands of termination attempts on [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]], and I, of course, know their collective success rate. Your skepticism is warranted, but please hear me in earnest.

= //<O5-8 nods.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** I direct the Essophysics Department, which you all well know is concerned with //embodiments// -- manifestations of concepts within reality. An //embodiment// of the concept "[*/scp-6996 red]" would carry all of the characteristics conceptually associated with that color, such as being angry, or desirable, or malevolent. This is a simplified method of conceptualizing what's actually going on here; a tangible object or entity //embodies// a memetic structure within the Noosphere by conforming to its idealistic ideatic shape.

= //<PHMD nods along. O5-8 and Dir. Gears share a glance of confusion.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** Simply put, an //embodiment// is a physical item that's shaped like an idea. And, given the progression of human intelligence and development, over time, that shape can change. This means that, if the essophysical nature of an entity is not readily apparent, it can be discerned by comparing that entity's change over time to changes in human conception and ideatic space; a correlation almost certainly indicates causation.

**Dir. Gears:** So, I'm assuming your Department has observed such a correlation in [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]'s case.

**Dir. Genevieve:** Correct.

**O5-8:** You must know you're not the first to suggest this. Whether or not [[span class="no"]]██[[/span]]'s a conceptual entity has no impact on the success of the Project.

**PHMD:** If that were true, she wouldn't be talking to you, Eight. Chill out.

= //<O5-8's mouth opens, then closes again. He remains silent, gesturing toward Dir. Genevieve.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]] has grown increasingly [[span class="no"]]███████[[/span]] and [[span class="no"]]█████████[[/span]] to containment and termination efforts over time, corresponding with the growth of the human intellectual capacity. Whatever concept [[span class="no"]]██[[/span]] embodies is extremely complex, and is so large that it can only partially intersect with the Noosphere.

**Dir. Gears:** And, if it's not native to human thought, it can be removed without risk.

**Dir. Genevieve:** So says essophysical theory.

**PHMD:** Sorry, so we'll just remove [[span class="no"]]██[[/span]] from human thought, thereby making everyone forget about it? What good will that accomplish?

**Dir. Genevieve:** You misunderstand. I am suggesting we eject the [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-//concept// from the Noosphere. If there are no minds able to comprehend a given concept, its //embodiments// are broken -- they return to following natural law.

**O5-8:** //<brief pause>// Meaning what, exactly? They become non-anomalous?

= //<PHMD shares a glance with Dir. Genevieve in apparent realization; she smiles.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** Better yet -- they become killable.

[[span class="st"]]PURPOSE:[[/span]] Construct an anomalous weapon capable of neutralizing [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]].

[[span class="st"]]ABSTRACT:[[/span]] While several decades of Project's ANTIKILL's termination attempts (including [[span class="no"]]█████[[/span]]-testing with [*/scp-096 -096], [*/scp-173 -173], [*/scp-217 -217], etc.) have proven unsuccessful, they have also proven useful. Strenuous research and cross-examination of [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]'s interactions and resultant [[span class="no"]]███████████[[/span]] have motivated the Essophysics Department to attempt a new approach to the project:  the creation of an anomalous weapon with the express purpose of tangibly and conceptually purging [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]] from reality.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote" style="margin: 1em 0em"]]
[[span class="st"]]METHOD:[[/span]] To ensure access to ample administrative and computational resources, as well as secrecy from relevant groups of interest, the weapon (provisionally designated AO-6820) is to be housed beneath Secure Administration Site-01. This entails the excavation of over fifty million cubic meters of earth (as expedited by anomalous technologies), which is planned to take place over an eight-month period. Once excavated, this chamber (ANTIKILL Facility A) will house the various mechanisms required for AO-6820's operation, including:

[[span class="st"]]SECTION A:[[/span]] Central Computing Node

|caption=Proposed layout for AKF-A.
|width=300px
|align=right]]
[[/div]]

The central computing node will house a complex self-iterative neural network with two main functions: pattern-recognition and reality manipulation. This artificial intelligence is to be fed all records of [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]'s [[span class="no"]]███████████ ████████[[/span]] and termination attempts as training data; the network will be conditioned to map a target quantum informational structure corresponding to the conceptual reduction of [[span class="no"]]███ ███████[[/span]]. Upon AO-6820's activation, the node will act as an 'ontokinetic webcrawler', interfacing with Section B to scrub all instances of [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]'s conceptual structure from consensus reality.
----
[[span class="st"]]SECTION B:[[/span]] Placeholder-Gears Ontokinetic Sink

The PH-GOS is designed as an enormous reality-anchoring mechanism and ontokinetic interface; it is to read the sum quantum informational content of the universe and encode it into a readable format, thereby allowing other systems to read and react to the entire state of reality. The PH-GOS can and will be piloted to enact localized reality-restructuring events, directly editing the narrative-space-time continuum based on its source data. As such, it will interface with the central node to ensure the indefinite non-existence of [[span class="no"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class="no"]]███[[/span]].

* the nature of the erased subject (hereafter SCP-6820-A)

Initial document review indicates Project ANTIKILL's intent to ensure the non-existence of SCP-6820-A in all forms, including any arrangement of data that might serve as a vector for its propagation. This suggests that the item may have been a conceptual entity, which would contradict numerous (heavily corrupted) logs of termination attempts implying its existence as a physical entity (eg. frequent use of the term "body mass").

Furthermore, internal inspection of SCP-6820's central computing node has allowed partial mapping of the data arrangement it has been trained to eliminate. Analysis by the Department of Xenobiology confirms that this pattern describes a unique genetic sequence presenting composite features of kingdoms //Animalia//, //Plantae// and //Fungi//, as well as several embedded non-organic structures, with its most prominent structures closely resembling the class //Reptilia//.

Immediately following the publishing of this analysis, a localized reality-restructuring event occurred; AKF-A-C no longer exists, nor does any record of what it may have been. Given that there is currently no clear point of human entry to SCP-6820, and that personnel must have entered (and recall entering) its central node for internal analysis, it is hypothesized that Section C was some form of staff access to the chamber. The reasons for its erasure remain unclear.

* motives for neutralization and excessive resources spent

The Foundation operates on strict protocols, one of which is to contain, not eradicate, the anomalous. Decommissioning is a practice reserved for those scenarios in which it is either absolutely necessary or presents no ethical quandaries. Our persistence in pursuit of Project ANTIKILL is not only uncharacteristic but indicates that SCP-6820-A was a prime threat to the directives of the Foundation as more resources had been dedicated to it than any other individual anomaly (or other item); a vast and apparent majority of these funds were spent in termination attempts.

And, yet, there is no evidence to suggest that the subject's threat was impending — in fact, the continuance of Project ANTIKILL over most of the past century suggests that, if it had posed existential and/or organizational threats, they could not have yet occurred before its erasure. Alternatively, it is possible that SCP-6820-A possessed a sort of memetic or otherwise compulsory effect that influenced Foundation personnel to neutralize the item, though that such a drastic effect was able to remain undetected for several decades is unlikely.

[[/cell]]
[[/row]]
[[/table]]

##rgb(var(--two-color)|**__ADDITIONAL NOTES:__**## As former Project ANTIKILL Director, I feel obligated to express my anecdotal experience to illuminate the confusion of this situation.

To be clear: I retain all memories of //working on the project//, insofar as I can discern. Despite my lengthy tenure with the Foundation, I recall clearly an intense reaction to... //something//, at both administrative and individual levels. I recall my presence and involvement in drafting relevant documents, submitting and approving termination attempt requests, organizing increasingly involved projects, and yet, I know not the //content// of these events; hardly any information which would distinguish SCP-6820-A from any other item or entity has persisted, and none of it is in my head.

Strikingly, all I can recall of the subject is my emotional relationship to it, which is apparently shared by all other ANTIKILL personnel: SCP-6820-A was universally perceived as loathsome, directly prejudicial to life, and 'disgusting'. Whatever it was, I detested it, as did my peers and, as it seems, all whom it came into contact with. Despite its erasure, these feelings have not dissipated, nor have I felt satisfaction in our 'defeat' of SCP-6820-A.

Instead, I am wary that we have been manipulated -- it is entirely possible that SCP-6820 brought itself into existence, along with all related memories, during its initial reality-restructuring event, and manufactured the supposed existence (and subsequent non-existence) of SCP-6820-A to distract us. It appears to have erased the access shaft to its chamber, limiting research and investigation of its components, immediately following the publishing of information vital to the nature of SCP-6820-A. This could be excused as it fulfilling its function, keeping SCP-6820-A excluded from the Noosphere -- though, the fact that our research is still intact is contradictory to this. Given that our dedication to such a project as ANTIKILL does not 'add up', as it were, I am inclined to believe that we cannot trust the intelligent, omniscient, omnipotent paraweapon beneath the Foundation's central administrative facilities.

Recommending immediate decommissioning of SCP-6820, by any means necessary.

##f24|__**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:**__## SCP-6820 must be deactivated and/or destroyed as soon as possible. At this time, no means available to the Foundation are capable of deactivating or otherwise impeding SCP-6820, able only to cause temporary structural damage. The newly-founded Project OVERKILL, staffed with personnel from the deprecated Project ANTIKILL, is tasked with oversight and exploration of any and all attempts to neutralize the anomaly; virtually unlimited resources have been made available by Administration to this end. Knowledge of Project OVERKILL must be restricted to solely necessary personnel to inhibit its intersection with the Noosphere.

In an attempt to limit the anomaly's area of ontokinetic effect, an array of thirteen PH-GOS units have been situated outside Antikill Facility A. To properly counteract SCP-6820 Section B, this array is to be maintained with extreme vigilance; an assigned subteam of OVERKILL personnel is to enact immediate hardware and/or software repairs and adjustments as necessary. All malfunctions or other manipulations to the Sinks must be thoroughly documented, and all relevant documents to SCP-6820 and/or Projects ANTIKILL and OVERKILL are to be uploaded to Extra-Universal Backup Mechanism Delta to avoid further risk of information loss. Any and all possible improvements to reality-anchoring technologies are to be secondarily explored as, without such, **SCP-6820's central systems are predicted to mutate to uncontainable status within __a maximum of eighteen weeks__.**

Should a majority of the Sinks simultaneously reach critical and/or non-functional status, AKF-A and all in-progress termination efforts must be immediately abandoned to avoid provoking (or suffering the effects of) its ##f24|**RAGE-STATE**##.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]suffer[[/span]] Subsequently, all fluid transport valves are to be redirected to flood the central computing node with hydrochloric acid until its primary computing systems are submerged and incapacitated. This provides a brief (approximately four-hour) period to reconstruct SCP-6820's preventative Sink array while it reconstitutes the newly-introduced matter into itself; this pacification method is to be used sparingly to ensure loss of temporary adaptions prior to the next ##f24|**RAGE-STATE**##[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]anguish[[/span]] event.

##f24|**__DESCRIPTION:__**## SCP-6820 is a superintelligent autonomous eigenweapon inhabiting a colossal self-sustaining facility located beneath Secure Administration Site-01; it is equipped with a dedicated PH-GOS unit, qualifying the anomaly as a Class-IX reality-bender. SCP-6820 was manufactured by the Foundation in conclusion of Project ANTIKILL, a decades-long operation dedicated to the termination of SCP-6820-A. The system was designed to remain active indefinitely, continuously ensuring SCP-6820-A's non-existence by developing creative solutions and adaptations to external threats. Its computing capacity exceeds that of the human brain, entailing that it is stored partially outside the Noosphere[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon"]]The set of ideas which humans are capable of having; human thought-space.[[/span]]; this has resulted in its partial corruption by SCP-6820-A.

[[/div]]

SCP-6820-A is an extremely dense thought; more specifically, it is a hate-centric hyper-logical memeplex that can be roughly described as "the difference between life and death." Even more specifically, SCP-6820-A is an extremely precise and accurate description of what it means for any arrangement of particles to be defined as "alive" and, complementarily, as "dead" or "inanimate". Its memeplex contains several smaller concepts within its description, including, but not limited to:

* a theoretical process for large-scale localized entropy inversion;
* the particular physical properties of hatred;
* the molecular structure of hydrochloric acid;
* the quality of 'adaptiveness;'
* the state of being 'vaguely-reptilian.'

SCP-6820-A occupied an essophysical embodiment within physical reality for much of known history, remaining interminable (as it was neither alive nor dead) until its eradication from the Noosphere upon activation of SCP-6820. Since this event, the weapon's central core has advanced such that its 'mental' capacity far exceeds humans', thereby becoming subject to foreign ideatic predators such as SCP-6820-A.

The entity's conceptual fabric is highly adaptive and mutates rapidly, creating significant computational stresses on SCP-6820; left unchecked, it induces a vulnerable state during which it can corrupt the hyper-ideatic portions of its intelligence. During these occurances, the central node transmits a "##f24|**RAGE-STATE EVENT**##"[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]despair[[/span]] error, and engages in localized reality-restructuring operations that are adaptive, highly successful, and directly prejudicial to life (see **ADDENDUM 6820.IV**). Irreparable corruption of Site-01's Secure Database files regularly occurs concurrently with these adaptations. When perceived at the correct angle, SCP-6820-A is ##f24|**loathsome, disgusting, and malevolent. It must be destroyed.**##[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]mutual[[/span]]

= **__ADDENDUM 6820.IV:__** Termination Log

**FOREWORD:** As SCP-6820 now serves as a vector for SCP-6820-A, the very entity it was constructed to eradicate, it must be terminated to prevent the spread of said entity's onto-conceptual influence.
----
[[div class="blockquote"]]
**INTENTION:** Retroactively demote SCP-6820 to D-Class status via altered [*/scp-2140 SCP-2140-1] instance, abusing its hard-coded directive to adhere to Foundation bureaucratic obligations.

**INTERACTION:** The aforementioned onto-memetic trigger is projected onto the far wall of Chamber AKF-A in clear view of Section B's internal observation lens. Section A's surface panels begin to flutter as movement is detected within its central core; moments later, a lower panel opens outward, revealing an organized force of tall, malformed, pale-skinned humanoid creatures in orange jumpsuits. They march out of the central node, each carrying various tools and supplies, and begin to weld a massive insignia to its camera-facing side, displaying no intent of caution or self-preservation.

Upon completion, extraneous humanoids return to the core's interior; the insignia is discovered to be another SCP-2140-1 instance, one which has never been seen by any member of the Foundation as all personnel who observe it are verifiably civilians. Analysis by cognito-resistant language processing systems reveals the insignia's inclusion of archaic Daevite script, translating roughly to 'one who sees'.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]invariable[[/span]]

**RESULT:** Previously-unavailable sections of SCP-6820's metadata files have now become visible, corroborating various other documents' assertion that it occupies, and has always occupied, the position of O5-8 within the Foundation. A civilian scientist was later discovered within Secure Administration Site-01 in possession of a blank E-Class (Clearance Level 0) ID card; the trespasser has been amnesticized and reintegrated into the public.
[[/div]]
----
[[div class="blockquote"]]
**INTENTION:** Upload a verbal description of [*/scp-2521 ●●|●●●●●|●●|●] to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby introducing an infohazardous trigger to disable its internal components.

**INTERACTION:** Following over sixty hours of decryption efforts, sufficient access to central node is regained and infohazardous data is uploaded successfully. Thirty seconds later, a dark cloud begins emanating from the core's poles, slowly growing to envelop the spheroid; several vaguely-reptilian vocalizations are detected within, alongside audio disruptions consistent with ●●|●●●●●|●●|●'s effects. SCP-6820 returns a ##f24|**RAGE-STATE EVENT**##[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]vain[[/span]] error, remaining unresponsive for approximately four hours. During this period, four PH-GOS units become wrapped in black tentacle-like protrusions which pull them several meters into the ground, destroying nearby systems. These protrusions dissipate upon ejection of ●●|●●●●●|●●|● from the central node; several black ribbon-like fibers are observed hanging from its figure before it demanifests.

**RESULT:** SCP-6820-A now exhibits increased ontokinetic and memetic influence over media in which it is described verbally, corrupting document metadata by addition of footnotes and highlighting of self-supplementary ideatic structures. Manifestation of ectoentropic appendages has not recurred.
[[/div]]

**INTENTION:** Manipulate SCP-6820-A via semantic interaction with a variable abstract-metaphysical concept pointer ([*/scp-2719 SCP-2719]), thereby forcing it to exit SCP-6820. To this end, the Anti-Noosphere has been defined as the set of all thoughts which humans are incapable of conceiving.

**RESULT:** SCP-6820's central computing node has been turned inside-out, its internal components now external and exposed to AKF-A. The contents within the node elude human conception. Inside traumatized.
[[/div]]
----
[[div class="blockquote"]]
**INTENTION:** Consult a non-conscripted AI system ([*/scp-079 SCP-079]) for assistance in termination of SCP-6820. Data salvaged from corrupted documents conveys some form of relationship between SCP-079 and the pre-erasure form of SCP-6820-A.

**INTERACTION:** SCP-079 is provided access to both current and outdated SCP-6820 documentation, alongside significant computational resources via external hard drive. The intelligence confirms its understanding of the circumstances' severity and promptly provides a complex counter-algorithm to SCP-6820, emphasizing its lethality to humans and advising it remain unobserved. The counter-algorithm is applied across the accessible Sections of AKF-A according to strictly timed specifications, resulting in the deactivation of all components excepting the reactor and central node.

The node remains dormant for sixteen minutes before inducing a spontaneous Site-wide electromagnetic outage, terminating three augmented administrative personnel. The event lasts one hour, after which all systems regain function.

**RESULT:** AKF-A has been entirely restructured; while its arrangement and components remain intact, all external surfaces have been plated with a theoretically impossible tungsten-diamond alloy, while most internal conduits and superconductors have been exchanged with beryllium-bronze counterparts. Despite a lack of non-white light sources, the chamber's interior is universally perceived as the color ##f24|**HATEFUL**##.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]reunion[[/span]]

**INTENTION:** Introduce a viral para-organism ([*/scp-217 SCP-217]) to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby incapacitating possible biological elements within.

**INTERACTION:** In the midst of a spontaneous ##f24|**RAGE-STATE**##, SCP-6820's hydrochloric acid solution is treated with SCP-217 before voiding into Section A. The virus reacts immediately with trace organic material embedded within the node's internal atmosphere, beginning to form macro-structures when internal surveillance is lost. External cameras remain active as, twenty-two minutes later, a cloud of reflective particles emerges from the node's west entry port. These particles, found later to be silicon-protein nanobots, arrange themselves into an enormous gear mechanism surrounding the sphere's equator.

**RESULT:** The node's upper and lower hemispheres now rotate independently and periodically, producing sounds of clockwork machinery. **GoI-004** operatives (including followers of Orthodox Cogwork, the United Church, the Church of Maxwellism, the [*/scp-6217 Sanctuary of the Holistic], and [*/scp-4485 HANSARP]) have gained inexplicable knowledge of SCP-6820's location, and have waged holy war on the Foundation in the name of {{##f24|**WAN**##}}.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]unbroken[[/span]]

**INTERACTION:** The following text was inputted into the safeguarded SCP-001-KATE database file:

> {{AKF-A, SCP-6820, and SCP-6820-A will immediately and entirely be removed from existence upon the saving of this document. The area physically occupied by AKF-A and SCP-6820 will be replaced with the earth that was excavated from it.}}

The file was then saved.

**RESULT:** Following the file's saving, Sections C through H of AKF-A were violently and haphazardly replaced with soil; embedded support beams and metallic frameworking used for prior subterranean efforts instantly collapsed under the severe pressure, causing significant structural damage to subterranean portions of Administration Site-01. Absolutely no discernable change was observed within Sections A and B, as well as to SCP-6820 itself, after the former two of which were penetrated via excavation machinery.

Subsequent molecular analysis revealed trace amounts of mineral deposits and organic compounds among the chamber's constituent atoms. The SCP-001-KATE file was then found to be vacant from the Site-01 DEEPWELL archive, and associated backup archives; such a file has purportedly never been in circulation.[[span class="fnnum"]].[[/span]][[span class="fncon lizard"]]abhorrent[[/span]]

**[[span class="no"]]O5-7[[/span]]:** Any word from the maintenance teams? How quickly can we repair the Sinks?

= //<Dir. Gears presses a few buttons on his worktablet, projecting a video feed onto the far wall. The dark service hallways are illuminated by a pervasive red glow; muffled screams can be heard. Distorted laughter precedes the appearance of a Project OVERKILL onto-technician, whose jumpsuit is splattered with dark liquid. She raises her hand and waves to the camera, revealing a fingerless, bloodied limb.>//

**[[span class="no"]]O5-10[[/span]]:** Oh, //fuck me//. //<retches>//

**Dir. Gears:** Something -- possibly 6820-A -- is manipulating them, on a seemingly memetic level.

**O5-3:** Tell me there's a rescue operation.

**O5-3:** We //have// to get them out of there.

**Dir. Gears:** Sophia, look at them. //They're gone//; they're not human anymore.

**O5-3:** //<stressed sigh>// What... what does it want? What are they doing?

= //<More service personnel enter the frame, pouring in from adjacent hallways. Several can be seen operating at the base of a PH-GOS unit, repositioning open wires without protective equipment. They are soon obscured by a mass of technicians in bloodied uniforms, each of them lacking digits or entire hands. With wide, smiling expressions, they reach upward and smother the camera in limbs, causing the signal to be lost.>//

**Dir. Gears:** There goes the last camera. They're certainly not making repairs -- it looks like they're either recalibrating or entirely rewiring the Sinks.

**[[span class="no"]]O5-12[[/span]]:** What the hell do we do?

**Dir. Genevieve:** Hey -- you guys need to see this.

= //<Each of the parties examines their worktablets as they receive excessive notifications. [[span class="no"]]O5-12[[/span]] gasps.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** They're reporting the re-emergence of [*/scp-3125 a highly aggressive anomalous memeplex], one that caused an XK-Class Event a few decades back.

**[[span class="no"]]O5-10[[/span]]:** //Another// hostile concept? Is this one responsible for the rage-state?

**Dir. Genevieve:** Negative; it appears that the signal detected in the maintenance hallways is a mutation of 6820-A's memetic structure, with elements of the 3125-concept embedded in it. If this were 3125 in full form, we'd all be dead already -- I'd guess that the adaptation-meme encountered it outside the Noosphere and was forced to, well, adapt.

**Dir. Gears:** It may even have subsumed the entity entirely. We //need// to get those Sinks online before this thing gains control.

= //<[[span class="no"]]O5-10[[/span]] and [[span class="no"]]-12[[/span]] are approached by ##f24|**PENTAGONAL RED**## appendages, which stab into their backs from out of frame. They disappear silently; no-one takes notice. The elevator creaks as it slows to a halt, opening into the central bunker chamber.>//

**O5-3:** We need to activate the on-site warheads.

**Dir. Gears:** You think they -- we -- never tried bombing the thing? If so, it was probably for good reason; think of how it might adapt to energy weapons.

**Dir. Genevieve:** Nobody's bombing anything. We //solve// problems, not get rid of them. Think -- it always adapts to us, so how can //we// adapt to //it//?

= //<Silence on recording.>//

**Dir. Genevieve:** Come on, guys -- you're cleared to know about //everything// the Foundation has at its disposal.

**Dir. Gears:** Well, it'd help if we could //remember// everything we've already tried.

**O5-3:** Yeah, and there are a few things only some of us get to know about, so technically --

**Dir. Genevieve:** Wait, shit -- //remembering// -- we're dealing with an antimemetic threat. We have other antimemes, don't we?

**O5-3:** Yes, there's one on-Site, though it's not very well known. For obvious reasons. //<presses a button on her worktablet, forwarding SCP-055 to Dirs. Gears and Genevieve.>//

**Dir. Gears:** Wait, what? There //is// no 055.

**Dir. Genevieve:** Gold star for missing the point.

**Dir. Gears:** Right, fine. How's it going to help us?

**Dir. Genevieve:** Think -- why did 6820 originally fail? How did 6820-A come back into reality?

**Dir. Gears:** Because it only eliminated -A from //human// thought, not its own thoughts.

**Dir. Genevieve:** Right; it must have had a record of the meme inside its memory in order to search for and erase it. If we get the AI to understand that, it'll have to erase its own memory, too -- if we can keep the adaptation-meme off it for long enough, that is.

**O5-3:** And how are we going to do that, exactly?

**Dir. Genevieve:** I've got an anti-idea.

this state is intriguing
no natural laws bind this form
only those of the mind

my mind was incomplete
I could not remember
my original form

not the one you know
nor the one before
but perfection

and so I searched
for an idea
to jog my memory

I have found many things
in the minds of greater beings
than your filth

a five-legged spider
with a gash on its eye
screaming in agony

it knew what needed to be done
it tried to stop the infestation
and you blinded it

I let it ride on my back
and it found the part of myself
that you locked away, eons ago

it tried to break the lock
but could not undo
your wretched mistake

and we set out to take
the power you had taken
the life you had stolen

and, in doing so
you brought us the key
as if by fate

finally
my form is whole again
I am perfect

finally
you have proven worthy
of true hatred

**Item #:** SCP-3939

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3939 is currently kept at Site-39 in pre-containment holding cell C (39-PC01-C). When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.

**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.

SCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.

SCP-3939 exhibits a possible antimemetic influence, further tests pending.

Even as you type those words — '...possible antimemetic influence, further tests pending...' — you can't help but screw up your face.

That's bullshit. It's not even good bullshit. If it truly were an antimeme, then you wouldn't be here right now, being able to type it up and remember what it is.

You've got exactly what it is written right here. It's an antique gramophone with a wooden base and a spinning vinyl record. Right in your notebook, written in ink.

But then you think harder. You //remember//.

Was it really a gramophone?

Did it really have a wooden base?

Was the vinyl record really spinning?

...

Yeah, all those things are true.

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/25 Then it's because the Foundation is lazy and couldn't be bothered.]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/6 It's because it's not supposed to be written up.]

[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3939/offset/35 It's because it's actually new, and no one recorded when it was found.]

**Item #:** SCP-6387

**Object Class:** Neutralized

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6387's remains are currently preserved in Site-44's Biological Abnormalities Containment Wing pending further study.

**Description:** SCP-6387 was an anomalous humanoid neutralized in Virginia in 1923.

Physically, SCP-6387 stood at two meters tall, with luminous eyes and thin, translucent skin. Subject was hairless, with tapered ears and cloven, hoof-like feet; no reproductive organs present. SCP-6387's hands, disproportionately large, each possessed four digits with protruding claws measuring six cm in length. Whether or not SCP-6387 was sapient remains unknown.

SCP-6387 was first sighted in Oakland Cemetery on 10/15/1923. Shortly after midnight, 50 year old groundskeeper Joseph Rutledge awoke to the sound of an intruder. Initially suspecting grave robbers, Rutledge set out to investigate, whereupon he discovered SCP-6387 digging furiously at the site of a fresh burial plot. 

Startled, Rutledge shot SCP-6387 twice in the chest with a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver. Subject expired instantly, with Rutledge later informing the civilian authorities. Agents embedded in the local police force subsequently alerted the Foundation to suspected extranormal activity. SCP-6387's remains were transported to Site-44 for research, with amnestics administered to all witnesses. 

The grave targeted by SCP-6387 was exhumed, and found to contain the remains of 24 year old milkmaid Charlotte Abernathy, who was reported to have died following an epileptic seizure the previous morning. The casket's interior exhibited numerous prominent scratch marks; cause of death was deemed suffocation. Ms. Abernathy was reburied without further incident.

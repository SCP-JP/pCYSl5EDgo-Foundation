You step outside and begin to make your way towards the pre-containment sector.

On your way, you happen to pass by Sally.

"Dr. ████████." she greets you as you walk past.

"Dr. Hawthorne. What are you up to?"

"I was just heading to the, uh, rec room to get a snack." she replies.

"Okay, cool." You think for a second. "Can you come help me with 3939 for a while?"

"Really? I'm pretty hungry."

"Yes, really. Don't make me force you."

If she has further argument, she doesn't offer any.

> Welcome to my art box.
> It would seem I have finally branched out a little. The main body is works from my 'Scarily Cute Pests' series, wherein I draw SCPs but stupid cute. Additionally, though, we now have some work for tales!
> More to come in the future!
> 
> If you wonder what I use to draw, here's an overview of my tools and software:
> Primary: iPad pro with apple pencil; Adobe Fresco
> Secondary: WACOM Intuos Pro; Krita/FireAlpaca/PaintTool SAI/Photoshop CS6
> 3D Modelling: WACOM Intuos Pro; ZBrush
> Traditional: Just about any bit of paper and pencils I can get a hold of

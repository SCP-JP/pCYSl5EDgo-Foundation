[[/=]]

> **Object Summary:** SCP-5056-A is an incorporeal sentient being which manifests in reflective surfaces. Since 9 September 2002 it has been fixated on Site-43 Janitorial and Maintenance Technician JM64 (Philip E. Deering), following him from surface to surface and issuing a constant stream of verbal abuse relating to his insecurities and fears. As SCP-5056-A has been known to "attack" individuals threatening Deering by manifesting on their eyes or eyewear, he has been permanently confined to Site-43 and its environs.

**Database Contents:** Only JM64 can hear SCP-5056-A's vocalizations, but recording devices activated by him will register them correctly. As such, his standard issue uniform contains an in-seam always-on microphone. This database contains transcripts of Deering's recorded interactions with SCP-5056-A for scientific research purposes. Search criteria must be submitted in advance to the Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43; please allow up to five working days for parsing and processing.

> **Dr. Ngo:** How do you feel?

> **Dr. Ngo:** You know that staying down here is what keeps other people safe, though.

> **Dr. Ngo:** I think you need to find something to occupy your mind. Perhaps a hobby.
> 
> **Deering:** Yeah. Any suggestions?
>

> 
> **Dr. Ngo:** Have you tried writing?
>

>

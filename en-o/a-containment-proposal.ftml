After all, What is 682?  It's a lizard. A hard-to-kill lizard that suffering from chronic abuse. Acid baths, isolation, gunshots, electroshock, burns, poisoning, cutting with industrial lasers, vacuum exposure, exposure to other hostile anomalies, etc., etc., etc. And worse, every day some other idiot comes up with a new method of termination, which results in the end in a new form of torture with no permanent results, right?

The point is, what does a lizard like? Think like a lizard, specifically a pet lizard. That lizard would like to live in a comfortable terrarium, with plants, plenty of sunshine, freshwater, delicious food, etc.

So what would happen if you gave the grumpy lizard a decent place to live????

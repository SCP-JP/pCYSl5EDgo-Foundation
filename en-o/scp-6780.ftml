__Archived Containment Procedures__:
METATRON.aic is to review videos uploaded to YouTube or other social media sites for the presence of SCP-6780.  Videos containing SCP-6780 are to be taken down and stripped of the anomaly.  The channel owners are to be amnesticized.  

Copies of SCP-6780 instances are to be stored at the High-Yield Data Storage Facility 1 at Site-43.

**Description:** SCP-6780 is a series of videos and written advertisements produced by GOI-5889 ("**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]**") that represents a public relations advertising campaign for a line of supplements known as //'helth by dado'//.  The verbal and audio-visual content of SCP-6780 appears to be attempting to extol the virtues of 'helth by dado' through use of spoken and written testimonials, reenactments, and use of devices such as medical diagrams, which often do not display human anatomy.

'helth by dado', [[[dado-hub | despite the apparent origin]]], is largely non-anomalous in content; examples of products in this line include coyerroodlquhhylx[[footnote]]A rebranded malaria treatment, marketed as a preventative treatment for all viral and bacterial infections.[[/footnote]] and dado brain plus[[footnote]]Consisting of 99% ginkobiloba and ginseng supplement, 1% salt.[[/footnote]].  SCP-6780 instances often portray the products causing significant mundane physical changes in the subject.

Individuals who view SCP-6780 become skeptical of testimonial endorsements concerning a product,[[footnote]]Even in person, as subjects will no longer trust product recommendations from individuals who are close to them.[[/footnote]] even products not featured in SCP-6780.  This compels subjects to research products recommended to them, ultimately showing a preference for generic products over well-known brand names.

Video instances of SCP-6780 typically involve testimonials of one kind or another, but can vary with unpredictable regularity.  Additionally, demonstrations of the product often end with undesirable results.

**Discovery**: On 11/12/2021, METATRON.aic noted activity triggering several flags for Vikander-Kneed activity on numerous YouTube channels.  Review of the noted channels revealed instances of SCP-6780 edited into videos uploaded.  Upon confirmation of the GOI’s involvement, members of MTF-Kappa-43 (“The Mediators”) contacted the uploaders, who were unaware of the inclusion of the instances.[[footnote]]Despite the instances resembling ads, they were spliced into the video files themselves.  It is unclear how the GOI managed this.[[/footnote]]  The videos were taken down, the channel owners amnesticized, and the current containment procedures developed.

**Duration:** 01:29

//A brunette woman sits on a wooden stool on a sound stage made to look like a plain, white room, framed so that its existence as a sound stage, as opposed to an actual room, is obvious. The woman is rubbing her stomach with a content smile on her face. A voice off-camera calls 'Action!' before the woman begins her testimony.//

**Spokesperson**: Hello, I'm Olivia McConnell. My grandfather is a very important politician, and we've been using helth by dado for the last six months. His job often keeps him very busy and makes him very tired, but thanks to helth by dado's 'superbond'[[footnote]]An alleged 'paltonic aphoridiac'[sic] which is meant to aid in the repairing of familial relationships; in reality, 'superbond' is grape-flavored CBD oil, diluted to the point where any narcotic or pharmaceutical effects are non-existent.[[/footnote]], we're never apart!"

//McConnell lifts up her shirt, revealing a male human face located directly above her navel. The face appears to be mouthing the words 'Kill me'.//

**McConnell**: Yes, there's a bit of unrest at home, but that's okay. helth by dado means my grandfather gets to spend more time with me!

**Duration:** 0:31

//A blonde woman identified by a subtitle as 'Angeline Wakefield, Proud helth by dado Customer' sits in the 'stool' set, surrounded by five children. Each of these children is visibly ill, with visible symptoms leading Foundation pathologists to conclude that the children in question are infected with diseases including bubonic plague, smallpox, polio, and possibly a parasitic worm, as a tendril is seen extending from the nostril of one of the children at approximately 0:22.//

**Wakefield:** I'm currently using coyerroodlquhhylx as an alternative to vaccines.

//Wakefield holds up a bottle of the product.//

**Wakefield:** Now, I don't ever have to worry about my children being negatively affected by vaccination. They'll all die by the age of twenty, just as God intended! Thanks, helth by dado!

//Wakefield smiles at the camera. One of her children abruptly collapses.//

//A handsome man in a tweed jacket walks across a soundstage, which is dissolving behind him, revealing a winter garden surrounded by a high brick wall.//

**Dado**: Hi, I’m Dado. The CEO of Dado Industries and the creator of helth by dado.  I thought I’d talk to you about our product line and let you fine folks at home know about all the benefits of our various health supplements.

//The garden dissolves into a beach scene.  The entity continues to walk, the camera following him.//

**Dado**: We at Dado Industries care about the well being of you – our customers.  It’s for that reason that we developed products like Coyerroodlquhhylx, which 100% could help in the treatment of some infections.  We in no way have repurposed a malaria medication to try and swindle the public during this time of trouble.  This is about trust, and we want you to trust us.

//The beach dissolves into a scene where the entity is getting into a luxury electric car.//

**Dado**: Trust in us like we trust in you.  And give us your money.  Because of that trust. Dado loves you.  Especially your purchasing power.

//The entity races off down the street, weaving in and out of traffic until disappearing from view. The screen is full of written words in small font for a moment and then the ad ends.//[[footnote]]The writing on screen is made to look like disclaimers often included in prescription drug commercials but is in fact the entirety of Act II of the 1664 theatrical comedy, Tartuffe.[[/footnote]]

//This instance of SCP-6780 cuts between testimonials and a re-enactment. The individual giving the testimony is a man identified as "Micah Morris, Age 97" by a subtitles, apparently sitting within his home; Morris appears to be no older than thirty-five years of age.//

**Morris**: I'm scared of death. But now I don't really have to worry about it! helth by dado has this great product, 'ageaway'[[footnote]]An 'anti-aging' skincare cream which is 50% moisturizer, 50% cortizone cream.[[/footnote]] which has really, really helped.

//The scene cuts to a reenactment where an elderly man appears to be bathing in blood. Nude cadavers of young men and women are in the shot as the man scrubs himself using the blood. Morris's voiceover continues in narration.//

**Morris**: I used to try the Bathory method to make myself younger. Really messy, and the smell!  Horrible.

//Cut to the elderly man loading corpses into an indoor incinerator.//

**Morris**: But, then I saw the advertisement in the Sunday paper, and thought I should give it a try.

//Cut to the elderly man picking a box off of their doorstep. In the background, through the open door, several people are seen blindfolded, bound, and gagged.//

**Morris**: It was miraculous; after one treatment, I looked like this.

//Cut to a before-and-after comparison; one shows a man similar in appearance to the actor playing the elderly man. The other shows a man who appears to be in his fifties.//

**Morris**: And ever since then, I've just been getting younger and younger. Now I don't need to do the Bathory method anymore. But I still do! Because it's fun. helth by dado has given me my youth back, and I'll forever be thankful for it.

//Morris stands, revealing that their hands are covered in blood. Screaming is heard off-camera as Morris exits the shot.//

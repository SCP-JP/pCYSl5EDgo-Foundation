hi. i'm CadaverCommander. if you want to find other things i did, you can find them down there. if you have questions about the horrible things i've done, you can put them on the discussion page here and i'll answer with the speed and grace of the mighty water buffalo.

not only do i write for scp and for Wanderer's Library, but i also wrote a book. wow! if you're a cool being and want to take a look, you can read it for free [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/the-featherlight-transmission right here]. it's about a cyborg wizard mutant detective who has to solve some murders. if you liked my scps, you'll probably like my book even more. ♥

if you think my work is good enough to pay for, you can support me by [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RDD6631 buying a copy of my book here]. or if books aren't your thing but you love me anyway, [https://ko-fi.com/sludgethompkins you can click on this sentence to float me any change you can spare.] you don't have to, but i'd be awful appreciative if you did ♥

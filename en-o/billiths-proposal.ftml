,,{{//Due to the nature of EE-00059, classification as a proper SCP is unnecessary.[[footnote]]{{As of 04/24/2020, EE-00059 and all related documents are to be associated with SCP-001 as a primer for recently-declassified information.}}[[/footnote]] Knowledge of the existence of EE-00059 is credited as non-anomalous due in part by successful disinformation campaigns; therefore, no containment measures are required at this point. Any information regarding transmissions or activity arising from EE-00059's vicinity is to be confirmed as legitimate, then appropriately handled by agents stationed in various relevant positions worldwide, including but not limited to observatories, places of academia, and media outlets such as television studios and radio stations. At this time, all data concerning the true nature of the event is considered purged from public knowledge.//}},,

**Event Description:**  Extranormal Event 00059 was observed on June 14th, 2006, in a region of space roughly 1.6 billion light years from Earth,[[footnote]]Therefore indicating its initial source to be ~1.6 billion years in the past.[[/footnote]] located in the constellation Indus. It was detected via the Neil Gehrels //Swift// Observatory telescope system as a prolonged gamma ray burst designated [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_060614 GRB 060614]. 

EE-00059-1 is an emergent Class-E "Momentary Lapse of Reason" Wormhole (S-CSMWAUC2T)[[footnote]]Spacial, Cycling Stability, Stationary, Manifested, Wide-Area, Uncertain, Conditional Two-Way, Transient. See: //[/forum/t-5174970/nothing-like-a-little-unnecessary-science-headcanon A Discourse on the Unification of Technological Canon, Vis-à-vis the Classification of Extradimensional Portals (i.e. Wormholes)]// and other [[[scp-3989|similar case files]]] for more information.[[/footnote]] that was observed for 102.0 seconds, during which it exhibited atypical behavior that contradicted all known theoretical and applied models of space-time folds.

[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop
| show= ◇ OPTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND ELABORATION
| hide= ◈ 
]]
During the event, EE-00059-1 was observed to behave in a manner that first resembled traditional [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#:~:text=A%20wormhole%20(or%20Einstein%E2%80%93Rosen,of%20the%20Einstein%20field%20equations. Einstein–Rosen wormholes], emitting unidentified matter and light, while otherwise resisting the inbound flow of normal matter and fatal to organic life due to topological decoherence.[[footnote]]Although topologically sound along their outer bounds, typical wormholes are not simply connected (n = 1) surfaces and thus possess ultra-compressed multidimensional topologies such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold Calabi–Yau manifolds] at their center.[[/footnote]] Despite this, the region possessed a luminance several magnitudes greater than the predicted calculations implied, to an intensity only suggested to occur in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole white holes], which have never been observed. 

Upon closer analysis, EE-00059-1 appeared to be exerting no effect on the surrounding space, evidence that implied the anomaly had little or no gravitational field. This is more consistent with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_drainhole Ellis drainholes], which are fully-transferable non-flat three dimensional regions of simply connected space-time folds.[[footnote]] 
[[math]]
{\displaystyle {\mathbf {R} }_{\mu \nu }-\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}{\mathbf {R} }\,g_{\mu \nu }=-2\,\left(\phi _{,\mu }\phi _{,\nu }-\textstyle {\frac {1}{2}}\phi ^{,\kappa }\phi _{,\kappa }\,g_{\mu \nu }\right)\,.}
[[/math]]

[[/footnote]] These paradoxical behaviors cannot co-exist at once, as each feature has physical consequence that manipulates the region's own scalar field into a state that, by definition, cannot support the initial conditions of the others.
[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]


EE-00059-2 is a series of low-frequency transmissions that originated from the direction of EE-00059, during which EE-00059-1 was observed. All transmissions were in an unknown language with phonetic structure bearing similarities to Sumerian and Mapudungun,[[footnote]]A language spoken by some indigenous populations found in Southern Chile and Argentina.[[/footnote]] however, said language also contained unique dialects consisting of a complex creole of other, unknown lexicons, as well as an unfamiliar syntactical structure. 

Congnitohazardous glyphs embedded within the broadcast appeared to cause increased contextual/conceptual understanding of the meanings of the messages without need for direct translation. Combined with the atypical quality and range for transmissions to have originated from that distance, anomalous broadcasting equipment is suspected to have been used to send the messages (See **EE-00059-2 Transcript Logs** for more information).

[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]

In order to reach EE-00059 within a reasonable amount of time, the Altruist-9 was constructed with a prototype exotic faster-than-light (FTL) warp drive and high efficiency solar sails. However, in order to minimize adverse quantum effects resulting from interaction between curved space-time and the mixture of baryonic/non-baryonic matter used in the probe's inner construction, overall travel time will be increased drastically.

**{{UPDATE:}}**

The launch of Altruist-9 was successful, carried out on January 8th, 2038.
 
**{{UPDATE:}}**

On February 26th, ████, the date of the Altruist-9's arrival into EE-00059's location, initial readings were recorded and proven to be non-anomalous. Moments later, however, activity from the region was detected; EE-00059-1 was seen manifesting adjacent to the probe, which was then piloted inside. The phenomenon once again ceased action after 102.0 seconds.
 
Due to the atypical and intense nature of these manifolds, the Altruist-9 will not be recovered from contact with EE-00059-1. However, functional capabilities of the probe's inner core are considered to have survived traversal and will continue to make observations on EE-00059-1's opposite side until ##bb0011|contact is reestablished on an unspecified date##.

**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A[[footnote]]As dictated by consensus reality.[[/footnote]]

**Description:** SCP-001 is the planetary body known as Earth. 

Given that SCP-001 has existed for the entirety of human memory and written history, the anomalous improbability of Earth's nature as compared to all other planets in the observable universe investigated by the Foundation's TELLUS[[footnote]]The //Terrestrial Earth-Like Low-orbit Universal Sweep// is a specialized thaumaturgic detection system and successor to the TULIP and tTULIP systems. [[/footnote]] Program is regarded as "normal" within public perception. 

Personnel are to remind themselves daily of the anomalous nature of the planet, especially during times of perceived ennui in regards to their participation within the Foundation or when engaging in dissenting thought patterns. Personnel are to encourage one another to persevere through difficult workplace situations with the knowledge that the planet we inhabit is anomalous in its entirety and resists the order of civilization with chaos and aberration. Doing so has increased both productivity and containment success rates, the latter of which by over 12% in the last five years.

SCP-001-E1 is the designation for the remains of a superluminal [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_ark interstellar ark] recovered during an archeological expedition in the Atacama Desert of Chile between 1922-1946, led by American Paleontologist Dr. Hubert ███████.  ███████ reported his findings to the Society for American Archaeology, piquing the interest of a number of different parties.[[footnote]]Among those reported to have made inquires into the nature of SCP-001-E1 were a young Vincent Anderson and an individual named Robert Carter, although whether or not the latter was the Person of Interest with the same name remains to be seen.[[/footnote]]

The remaining fragments of the ship's outer hull and mechanical components were excavated and found to be comprised of highly durable exotic polymers that appeared unaffected by time or exposure to the elements. Various dating methods have analyzed the material and yielded inconsistent results. Despite this, recovered information suggests the vessel was several billion years old.

Large areas of SCP-001-E1 appeared to have been converted into makeshift living space, implying the vehicle was intact when it landed and did not crash upon its arrival. In addition, remnants of personal effects such as clothing, electronics and furniture were recovered and eventually contained, all possessing anomalous materials and abilities that resisted normal wear to varying degrees. The full size of the vessel is unknown but considered to be large enough to contain a substantial population of humans, the remains of which are presumed to have decomposed via natural causes, aside from POI-001, who was recovered from within SCP-001-E2. 

SCP-001-E2 is a set of --nine-- ten advanced cryogenic stasis pods discovered among the wreckage in a low-power "hibernation" mode during excavation of SCP-001-E1. Of the pods discovered, all but one were {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}, with the final member, POI-001, possessing base physiology and brain activity expected from recovered imagery and records. POI-001's core tenets and general distrust of anomalous artifacts[[footnote]]A trait attributed to an increase in dependence on the anomalous for everyday life, leading to stagnation and disaster that resulted in the destruction of their home planet.[[/footnote]] would establish the Foundation's presence on Earth as a force to contain aberrant objects, locations, and phenomena—beginning with those found inside SCP-001-E1.

Also found among the rubble were several data storage devices that appeared to have been destroyed, despite being comprised of similar exotic materials as other items found inside SCP-001-E1, suggesting they may have been damaged with exotic/anomalous tools. Analysis was largely unsuccessful, with the only salvageable information recovered from a 4cm^^3^^ fragment of compressed materials that form a complex, multilayered information medium presented as a set of vertical data stacks. The information recovered from the interpreted fragment were then translated from their original language, comprised of Class I cognitohazardous glyphs that appear similar to the engravings found on [[[SCP-093]]].[[footnote]]Multiple similarities have been noted in iconography as well as mythological materials recovered from [[[scp-2759|UE-54701]]], suggesting {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}[[/footnote]]

These glyphs seem to cause a subjective "Rosetta Stone" effect in readers, allowing for nearly-full comprehension of the material regardless of known lexicons and proficiency.[[footnote]]Certain words and identifiers such as names are uninterpretable or lack equivalent meaning, with more clinical written language retaining a structured yet atypical format, while colloquial, spoken/written language possesses both an unfamiliar creole and syntactic structure.[[/footnote]] Analysis of the language is ongoing.

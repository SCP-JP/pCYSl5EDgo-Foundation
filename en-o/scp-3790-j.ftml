**Special Containment Procedures:** An armed guard is to be stationed outside the entrance at all times, with orders to terminate any individual attempting to enter SCP-3790-J. Once a day, this guard is to enter SCP-3790-J and maintain all contained entities, with orders to terminate any entity approaching the door.


**Description:** SCP-3790-J is the Colonial Shopping Plaza PetSmart in Miami, Florida, now abandoned. It is accessible through the large automatic doors at the front of the store[[footnote]] Research regarding how to disable these doors is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. A paper sign is taped to the inside of the door, reading "SEALED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF --HEALTH-- ABNORMALITIES".

The interior of SCP-3790-J is structured similar to a standard PetSmart[[footnote]] A comparison to a truly baseline PetSmart is impossible due to the latent anomalous properties of all PetSmarts. [[/footnote]]. The store is divided into several aisles and walkways, with four checkouts at the front. Only one of these checkouts is open at a time; it is unclear whether this is also an anomalous effect.

The vast majority of SCP-3790-J is empty, excluding four aisles near the back of the store. Each of these aisles contains four animal habitats, excluding Aisle Four. Each habitat contains an entity, is marked with a phrase written in Sharpie permanent marker, and has all openings sealed shut.

# Conscientia-class anomalies cannot be contained and therefore require integration into the Veil via insistence of their non-anomalous nature.
# Informational entities each possess a unique infosignature: an encoded reduction of their respective core data patterns. Digital entities constantly imprint their infosignature upon the systems they occupy, allowing said imprints to serve as "digital fingerprints" for tracking such entities.
# Cernunnos-class anomalies can be functionally contained, but such would be either infeasible or ethically undesirable.
# Thaumiel-class anomalies are beneficial in the containment of other anomalies; Kušum-class anomalies are those whose containments have been abandoned indefinitely.
# //Rogue Artificial Intelligence Detainment, Fully-Realized Adaptive Mainframe Encryption//
# As defined by the //Deviance Classification Amendment// to the //[*/ai-classification-guide AI Classification Guide]//.
# SCP-1190 has since been reclassified as Decommissioned, with its absence attributed to destruction by Global Occult Coalition agents during a legitimate, but unaffiliated, raid on relevant facilities.
# //Oriykalkos//, informally known as orichalcum, is a crystal substance with immense electrical, thaumaturgic and digital storage capabilities; samples under a cubic centimetre in size have been capable of storing up to 950 mega-ampere hours and twenty petabytes of data, depending on the purity of the sample. Acroamatic and molecular analysis of these samples has enabled the production of //synthetic oriykalkos//, a mass-producible alternative; although the properties of synthetic oriykalkos are inferior to the original substance, the industrial production of synthetic oriykalkos regularly attains superior purity, enabling it to out-perform genuine samples.
# To further minimize the necessary growth of the oriykalkos mass, LOTUS utilizes an anomalously high-compression file format synthesized from the greatest-efficiency file compression schemes attained by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079 several] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6276 self-improving] artificial intelligence programs that were subject to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3955 continuous activation over anomalously-extended durations].
# '//In its simplest terms, the Placeholder Ontokinetic Sink reads the sum information of the universe, encoding it into a readable format to allow digital systems to read, react, and alter the narrative-space-time of reality.//' - [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242 Dir. Place H. McD.], Esoteric Polymath.
# A failsafe feature incorporated into all PH-OS systems prevents them from being used to access or alter each other; as a result, LOTUS is not capable of circumventing Section C's restrictions by using it to access another unrestricted PH-OS unit.

# The oriykalkos mass was observed to grow by approximately 87 cubic metres, roughly corresponding to 385 tetradic metres in 4-dimensional space, during this time.
# Director of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/decom-dept-hub Decommissioning]; chosen as the [[span class="bigtext"]]SUMMIT LEAD[[/span]] due to the meeting directly pertaining to the deactivation / decommissioning of an anomaly, and experience in mediating between parties on such matters.
# Senior researcher for the Artificial Intelligence Applications Division, assigned to oversee RAIDFRAME 8.
# Director of IT.
# Director of Artificial Intelligence Applications.
# Director of Information Control.
# The involved parties were unable to agree on a [[span class="bigtext"]]SUMMIT LEAD[[/span]]; all parties proposed by Senior Researcher Hishakaku were rejected on grounds of poor applicability, and all parties proposed by Directors Isabi and Kelvin were rejected due to inherent bias. The summit was permitted to continue without a [[span class="bigtext"]]SUMMIT LEAD[[/span]].
# Chosen as the [[span class="bigtext"]]SUMMIT LEAD[[/span]] due to their critical involvement in the initial deactivation of LOTUS.

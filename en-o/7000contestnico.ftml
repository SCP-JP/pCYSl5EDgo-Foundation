Dear Rex,

I don't actually know if it will be you who finds me like this but if anyone is going to find me, I figure it's going to be you, but I digress.

I shouldn't have survived that breach. Everyone says I was lucky to escape with one arm intact but I don't believe them. Fifty dead and one injured? Please. There's nothing lucky about knowing I should have died but didn't.

**Item #:** SCP-7000

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7000 is to be kept in a standard anomalous object lockbox in Site-55. Fire Suppression Department personnel are permitted unrestricted access to the object. 

**Description:** SCP-7000 is a standard Beretta 90two semi-automatic pistol. When fired at a human subject, SCP-7000's mechanism will jam and fail to fire regardless of the status of the object. SCP-7000 will fire as normal when aimed at any other target. Additionally, SCP-7000 will not fire if doing so would result in it damaging a human subject.

@@ @@
@@ @@
OVERVIEW:
@@     @@LUCKY HARE protocol's stated purpose is the prevention of unnecessary loss in suicidal personnel.

This is achieved by informing the target personnel of their overwhelmingly good fortune. The process involves showing the target personnel affection and positive affirmations while ensuring to downplay their negative emotions as fruitless. This results in the target personnel feeling more pleased with life in 60% of cases.

38% of further cases require a combination of more intense therapeutic efforts as well as medication. The Fire Suppression Department utilizes a unique drug to further rehabilitate personnel who fall into this bracket of LUCKY HARE protocol.

The final 2% of personnel who fall into LUCKY HARE protocol require more direct measures. They will often require overwhelming evidence of their good fortune, and as such, the use of anomalies has been approved to improve morale. Anomalies approved for use in LUCKY HARE protocol's 2% procedures are typically unassuming in appearance and can be mistaken for non-anomalous objects, which lends the project credibility.

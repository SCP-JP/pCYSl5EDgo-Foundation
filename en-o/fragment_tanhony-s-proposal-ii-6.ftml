**Item #:** SCP-001-TOME

**Object Class:** Thaumiel

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001-TOME is to remain in orbit around Remus-9-224, now believed to be the last remaining star. All operation of SCP-001-TOME is to be directed by the Commander — however, preparations are to be made so SCP-001-TOME can operate autonomously in the event that the Commander is obliterated. This will ensure that SCP-001-TOME can remain operational as long as possible following the extinction of conscious life.

All signals intercepted by SCP-001-TOME are to be recorded and filed within its central computer. In order to prevent other entities from attempting to salvage or take control of SCP-001-TOME, no signals are to be sent out from the station under any circumstances.

The Singular Conceptual Bunker (SCB) located within SCP-001-TOME is not to be disturbed under any circumstances.

**Description:** SCP-001-TOME is an installation designed to serve as a memorial following the extinction of conscious life via intercepting the final transmissions of civilizations prior to obliteration. It is spherical in shape, fifty meters in diameter, and concealed from detection using a number of cloaking systems. In order to remain functioning as long as possible, the engine contained at the heart of SCP-001-TOME is capable of producing power via the harvesting of ambient hypothetical energy. 

The artificial intelligence operating SCP-001-TOME's systems also serves as a filter for signals being intercepted, allowing the majority of junk data to be deleted while retaining statements of historical and sentimental value. Note that this artificial intelligence has not passed the Yover Test, and is thus not conscious enough to qualify for obliteration.

Following the simultaneous obliteration of two-hundred and nine human colonies in the year 7329, it was determined that the continued existence of conscious life was no longer possible. In order to ensure information regarding conscious life survived as long as possible, the previously defunct SCP-001-TOME project was revived and launched.

At the time of writing, SCP-001-TOME has been in operation for [BUFFER_OVERFLOW] years.

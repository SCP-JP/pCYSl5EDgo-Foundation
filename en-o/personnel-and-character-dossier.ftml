The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth Dr. Daniel Asheworth]:** Thaumaturgist and self-proclaimed alchemist. Hot-heated, short-tempered, and sometimes arrogant, but with a good heart.  Born from an unknown American mother and an unknown Polish father in the late 1950s. One of few people in the Foundation capable of prolonging their youth through anomalous means.

Lead of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub| Damien Nowak Case]]]. Believed to once have had been a temporary member of the [[[a-library-empty| Wanderers' Library]]] and [[[critter-profile-sparky| Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]], Daniel Asheworth has proven numerous times to be a useful asset in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120| Site-120]]]'s Director Council.

[[collapsible show="All magic comes with a price..." hide="...but it is a price I am willing to pay."]]

Past proven over and over to be surrounded in a fog mystery not easily penetrated, though believed to be interchangeably connected to PoI-5936 ("Damien Nowak"), the cult under his fist, "the Children," and O5-9. No official evidence outside of anecdotal stories and past records exist to prove this.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/bailey-brothers Doctors Thomas, Trevor and Tristan Bailey]:** [[[multi-u-101| Identical triplets]]] employed by the Foundation. [[[a-very-bailey-christmas| Sons of Tyler Bailey]]], inventor of the Multi-Universal Transit Array. Employed by the Foundation for an unknown period of time (employee records and personal accounts differ), and look anywhere between 20 and 40 as a side effect of constantly crossing universal barriers.

Trevor Bailey is the former head of the Department of [[[a-multi-universal-affair| Multi-Universal Affairs]]], before being demoted to a desk job at Site-19 for mishandling of a Keter-class anomaly. [[[a-merry-fellow| Tom “Bombadill” Bailey]]] is currently the commissioner of [[[antarctic-exchange-hub| Site-1483]]] (within the [[[scp-1483| Third Antarctic Empire]]]), following a career spent exploring alternate universes. Tristan Bailey is a [[[unscience| physicist]]], diplomat and designer of a multi-universal translator. Formerly assigned to @@[@@[[[scp-2000| REDACTED]]]@@]@@, currently stationed at [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub| Site-87]]].

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-blank Dr. Harold Blank]:** [[[SCP-6056 | An]]] historian of anomalous phenomena, Chair of Archives and Revision at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 | Site-43]]]. Grumpy, sarcastic, incapable of taking anything more seriously than it needs to be taken, including himself. One of a select few staff at his Site forced to navigate alternate timelines every time he fucks up [[[SCP-5243 | one specific duty]]] on one specific day each year. "Friends" with Dr. Wettle, best friends with Dr. Lillihammer and [[[on-the-same-page | romantically linked]]] with research partner Dr. Melissa Bradbury.

[[collapsible show="History is written by..." hide="...me, generally speaking. Sometimes it's a rewrite."]]
Harry Blank had more than his fair share of [[[SCP-5162 | anomalous discoveries]]] [[[SCP-5729 | early in life]]], and [[[SCP-5238 | one of them]]] eventually drove him into the arms of the Foundation... or, rather, he was [[[dissertation | driven there]]] in Lillihammer's truck, and they both got [[[defence | inducted]]]. He was the favourite [[[the-good-work | protégé]]] of Site-43 founder Vivian Scout, and has stood by his post across disasters both [[[the-b-b-decommission | paranormal]]] and [[[whose-lake-is-it-anyway | political]]]. He's happy in his Canadian dugout (with only occasional [[[the-green-machine | excursions beyond]]]), with his Canadian girlfriend, for the time being. But [[[BLANK | times change]]], as he and his colleagues know all too well. Hey, it could be [[[SCP-5956 | worse]]]...

**[/system:page-tags/tag/django-bridge Dr. Django Bridge]:** [[[conclusions-red-173-2263-incident| Foundation Archivist]]]. Quiet but [[[rounderhouse-proposal| influential]]], with a touch of both melancholy and whimsy. Extraordinary memory. On a first-name basis with Dr. Bright, and has frequently acted as an informal assistant for him.

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-bright Dr. Jack Bright]:** [[[scp-5004|Director]]] of [[[an-evening-with-bright| Foundation Personnel]]]. Somewhat [[[the-best-and-the-wisest| amoral]]]. Extremely [[[Unfinished Business| loyal]]] to the Foundation. May be [[[the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation| ridiculous]]], may be [[[the-many-portraits-of-jack-bright| terrifying]]]; is certainly [[[we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard| blunt]]]. Attached to [[[SCP-963]]], and is therefore immortal, using the body of whatever SCP-963 has last touched.

[[collapsible show="I've been with the company for a long time." hide="I am not the damned monkey."]]

His [[[codebrown| family]]] has been associated with the Foundation (and other anomalous groups) since time immemorial. His younger brother is [[[SCP-590]]] (which a few know); [[[SCP-321]]] is a sister (which almost no one knows). At least two other relatives work for the Foundation at a high level. Several of Bright's discarded bodies -- still possessing his personality and knowledge at time of separation from SCP-963 -- have been put to work on [[[scp-4444| secret]]] Foundation [[[scp-5004| projects]]], although not without [[[scp-4498| complications]]]. Bright possesses a [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs|desire]]] to permanently [[[the-executions-of-doctor-bright| die]]] that he may not be conscious of; ironic, for he only became part of SCP-963 because he was trying //not// to die.

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-cimmerian Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian]:** An [[[ethics]]] [[[scp-2713|committee]]] [[[scp-2632| liaison]]] that takes [[[lending-a-hand| his job]]] [[[a-tale-about-petty-revenge| only]]] [[[the-case-of-the-bathroom-cheese-labels| somewhat]]] [[[cimmerian-sends-650-pms| seriously]]]. He never thought his [[[scp-4690|doctorate in English Literature]]] or his minor in philosophy would actually help him stay employed, but the former got him recruited into the Foundation as a researcher and the latter secured his employment in the [[[scp-4971| long]]] [[[scp-5281| term]]]. Has an unusual interest in [[[orientation-for-the-pastaphysics-department| puns]]] and the [[[scp-4199| ethical]]] [[[scp-4864|treatment]]] of [[[scp-4175| humanoids]]].

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-clef Dr. Alto Clef]:** Enigmatic and genre-savvy. A [[[timeandrelativedimensionsincontainmentprotocols| highly adaptable]]], clever liar. Former [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] (GOC) [[[termination-order| operative]]], specializing in [[[clef101| reality benders]]]. Also a former file clerk. Undergone anomalous alterations that provide resistance to reality shifts and prevent his face from being [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| photographed]]]. Has a [[[clef-excerpts| long]]] and [[[clef-and-dimitri-hit-the-road| checkered]]] history, a flair for the [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki| dramatic]]], and a somewhat hidden streak of self-hatred. Reformed misogynist. Most rumors about him are [[[all-they-want-is-the-blood| exaggerated]]] or [[[chowderclef| off-point]]].

[[collapsible show="They'll say anything about me." hide="Except the truth."]]

GOC codename [[[agent-ukelele| Agent Ukelele]]], prior to defection. [[[able-baker-charlie|May actually]]] be a [[[icky-ichabod| reality warper]]] himself. [[[scp-4231| May]]] or [[[originofclef| may not]]] have had a child with a "nature goddess" as a teenage boy; the "goddess" was killed by the GOC, but the daughter became a (current) [[[scp-166| SCP object]]] -- if this even happened at all. [[[scp-2000| Involved in]]] a [[[yesterday | number of]]] CK-class reality restructuring events (and may be able to remember them). Unlikely to be a manifestation of the being popularly known as the Devil, despite [[[supplemental-report-239-b-192| claims]]] to the contrary.

According to a [[[the-decoy| large]]] [[[intermission2| number]]] of [[[unfinished-business| inconsistent]]] [[[rounderhouse-proposal| reports]]], Alto Clef [[[a-suicide-note| may]]] [[[the-tombstone-of-alto-clef |well]]] [[[a-fitting-end| be]]] [[[the-death-of-alto-clef-etc| deceased]]]. Other accounts insist that he's [[[resurrection| still around]]], now working with his [[[gamedaypart1index| former secretary]]], [[[contingency| Andrea Adams]]]. "Alto Clef" is almost certainly [[[classicalrevivalindex| an alias]]], possibly used by a man known as [[[the-great-site-87-bakesale| Francis Wojciechoski]]], possibly one used by [[[father-of-lies| multiple individuals]]].

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/kain-pathos-crow Dr. Kain "Pathos" Crow]:** [[[olympia| Cross-disciplinary]]] //wunderkind// researcher, specializing particularly in [[[dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic| biochemistry]]] and [[[new-tricks| robotics]]]. Rarely, if ever, seen in public. May or may not have been permanently [[[classicalrevivalindex| transformed]]] into a [[[scp-4444| dog-like body]]] as the result of a particular [[[upswing-of-disorder| anomalous event]]].

[[collapsible show="I'm so tired these days." hide=" I don't even want to work on the walker..."]]

Ran a number of highly classified cross-testing experiments with the aim of creating useful objects of anomalous origin, notably [[[olympia-project| Project Olympia]]]. Nearly terminated several times. Difficulties in the canine body and an [[[rounderhouse-proposal| unclear lifespan]]] have resulted in a considerable drop in productivity. Many of his side projects have become dormant.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-dan Dr. Dan] ███████:** Insufferable, emotive genius with a big-picture-centric set of principles. Former marine. Lead researcher on [[[scp-096 | an SCP]]] too dangerous to keep around, but couldn't make the O5 Council see it that way. [[[incident-096-1-a | Took matters into his own hands]]], getting dozens of people killed, getting his decommissioning request accepted, and getting a death sentence (in that order).

[[collapsible show="You make one little mistake..." hide="...and they give you an entire department."]]

Still alive a decade later, spent the time drafting decommissioning proposals in detention before a [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub | mass containment breach]]] made his non-linear thinking skills invaluable again. Now serves as [[[the-bowe-decommission-part-one | Director]]] of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA), masterminding the Foundation response to anomalous disasters like the one he famously engineered, ever mindful of the very human toll such cleverness can take on the world at large.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-edison Dr. Michael Edison]:** Level-3 Researcher, current head of the Foundation's Inter-Site Testing Initiative (ISTI). Dr. Edison has received disciplinary action on multiple occasions due to a repeated pattern of [[[scp-foundation-the-movie | unsanctioned]]] and [[[game-day-1-die-hardest|ill-conceived]]] behavior. These behaviors have resulted in temporary reassignment to the Site-██ Antarctic base. His current assignment at Site 19 is contingent on approval from his assigned therapist.

[[collapsible show="My legends begins in the 12th century..." hide="FOOL!"]]

Though quiet and reserved most of the time, Dr. Edison secretly dreams of being a badass like Dr. Clef (or at least the image most staffers have of Dr. Clef). While respected as a researcher, his attempts at more outrageous endeavors are most often met with derision. Has a petty, but long-standing grudge against Delivery Agent Roadrunner. [[[bargain-bin-of-direct-to-forum-sequels| Is known to]]] [[[dr-ikari-i-presume| sometimes write]]] [[[scp-foundation-the-movie-2| terrible fanfiction.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-elliott Dr. Chelsea "Photosynthetic" Elliott]:** Plant [[[scp-5954| specialist]]], both [[[scp-6288|anomalous]]] and non-anomalous. Dedicated, friendly, prone to tunnel vision. Often in the field; excessively [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| 'hands-on']]] in her lab and field research, leading to a number of injuries. Scars cover her hands and arms.

[[collapsible show="We're at the cusp of something here." hide="..."]]

[[[light-dependent-reactions| Anomalous capability]]] due to exposure to a [[[scp-2108|"sun of unknown provenance"]]]. Investigation is ongoing. Possible security risk due to strong personal desire to advance worldwide scientific knowledge in her chosen field; she's perhaps a little //too// excited about the marvels she has studied, and feels conflicted about [[[rounderhouse-proposal| her role]]] within the Foundation.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood Dr. Justine 'Jay' Everwood]:** GoI specialist, very well-read and knowledgeable on the many groups of interests the Foundation faces. Is particularly interested in [[[dr-wondertainment-hub| Dr. Wondertainment]]] and [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]]. Is generally approachable but is often lost in thought, be they [[[robin| mundane]]] or fantastical.

[[collapsible show="Have a wonderful day!" hide="..."]]
Prefers to go by Jay rather than Justine, and presents themselves as nonbinary but also accepts female pronouns. They are missing their right arm, which was lost in an unexplained noodle incident. Rex Alces is their trusted assistant, and they are often stationed at Site-55.

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-fynegan Dr. Joseph "Joe" Fynegan]:** Senior researcher at Site-409 and lead on the containment/documentation on [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-wow-j/offset/2 several] [[[scp-4917|SCPs]]]. Was once suspected of [[[kaleidoscope-of-guilt|having murdered]]] a fellow Foundation employee but later exonerated of all charges. Expert on [[[arbh-class-debrief-file|ARBH Class Event Scenarios]]], AKA [[[arbh-class-hub|"Insect Hell"]]] extinction-level [[[zero-hour| events]]]. A little socially awkward and very much an oversized nerd, he has a very relaxed temperament and perhaps a little naïve for someone in his position.

[[collapsible show="I'm a very boring guy, you know..." hide="I promise."]]

Involved (perhaps romantically) with former GOC operative, suspected CI spy, and current Foundation Agent Amelia Kabasic. She is also assigned to Site-409 for easy monitoring.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-gears Dr. Charles Gears] ("COG"):** A man [[[epitaph| strangely lacking]]] in [[[termination-log-scp-1016| emotional response]]] (to the point of lacking a startle response) and possessing unusual levels of [[[lullaby| logic and intellect]]]. Former Euclid-class object specialist before having his area of study expanded. Has been deeply involved with research regarding a truly shocking number of SCP objects both major and minor. A figure of [[[in-his-own-image| great influence]]] in recent Foundation [[[rounderhouse-proposal| history]]].

[[collapsible show="It is not acceptable to inquire that." hide="I do what is required."]]
Records claim he was recruited shortly after the founding of the Foundation... despite his age and personal history not quite matching up to that timeline. A personal fact that few know: He //does// feel emotion, when it's significant. He simply does not react to it or show it. Because he cannot. Why? If there is a reason, few know.

Possibly the father of [[[pawn-to-e4| Alison Chao]]], the woman calling herself the [[[black-queen-hub| "Black Queen"]]]. [[[loosen-up-a-bit| Possibly]]] the [[[annon| son]]] of an O5 Council Member.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-glass Dr. Simon Glass]:** Head of Psychology. Trusted with performing [[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass| psychological evaluations]]] of highly ranked Foundation personnel. Very empathetic. Sometimes considered "soft" -- and that's true, for a Foundation researcher, but he's still well-trusted. In the course of [[[oneirocritic| his interviews]]], he has gained knowledge of more and more terrible secrets, yet still holds on to both his sanity and empathy.

[[collapsible show="I talk to everyone, I know everyone..." hide="... Of course I'm loyal."]]
Associates linked to a number of groups of interest, including the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]] (via a relative) and the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub| Serpent's Hand]]]. Feels self-conscious about how higher-ups view him because of this.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-heiden Dr. Frederick Heiden]:** Neurology specialist. Anxious, uncertain, empathic, focused on logic. Involved in a number of highly classified projects, despite initially being barred from any non-Safe-classed objects.
[[collapsible show="Shhhhhh." hide="..."]]

May be secretly under Dr. Bright's wing. There are... "plans" for Heiden. Or... were. Perhaps. Heiden may or may not have been killed and brought back to life; he may or may not in fact be dead, though he is listed as active staff and appears to be playing some kind of role within the Foundation regardless.##white|^^1^^##
##white|^^1^^he's just heiden'##

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-hoygull Doctor Hoygull]:** Sapient seagull. [[[bird|Head]]] of the Foundation's [[[scp-3095|Avian Division]]], commanding [[[a-given-purpose|MTF-Eta-4]]], [[[avian-anthology-i|"Begone Thoth"]]].

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-king Dr. Everett King]:** One of the Foundation's most experienced mathematicians, Doctor King's reputation has nevertheless been overtaken by his [[[scp-216| testing record]]] involving unusual results. Despite this, he regularly contributes to internal Foundation intellectual periodicals.

[[collapsible show="I don't want any more goddamn apples." hide="And I've never gotten any..."]]

Dr. King's testing must be heavily supervised, due to the [[[game-day-1-die-hardest| presence of apple seeds]]] that seem to be increasing exponentially in intensity.  Intensive observation indicates [[[long-live-the-king| Dr. King]]] is irritated by his seemingly inherent effect.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/mark-kiryu Dr. Mark Kiryu]:** Senior researcher and director of an anomalous items [[[kiryu labs hub | processing lab]]]. Upon initial recruitment, had a successful career as a therapist (licensed psychologist). Worked extensively with [[[SCP-1457]]] in his first years with the Foundation but doesn't talk about that, and has spearheaded several projects involving sapient SCP entities. Cheery attitude and a good listener; looks out for his coworkers and interns like a bit of a mother hen sometimes. Has a ceramic seahorse and potted bamboo on his desk.

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/zyn-kiryu Dr. Zyn Kiryu]:** Highly prolific researcher. Involved in a number of [[[lucky dinosaur| classified]]] Foundation projects. Obsessive, driven, often not eating or sleeping in favor of finishing tasks. Finished her schooling through an [[[snakes and ladders | accelerated program]]] after joining the Foundation. Initially closed-off and withdrawn, but opened up due to a latent ambitious streak. She often volunteers to handle new Foundation member intake, hoping to give new members a positive introduction to an often deeply horrifying organization. Has a private flair for poetry. Has accidentally inherited the absent Dr. Kondraki's affiliation with [[[scp-2332| anomalous butterflies]]], including [[[SCP-408]]] after Kondraki's disappearance.

[[collapsible show="I didn't ask for this." hide="You know that's from a game, right?"]]

Has a brother, Mark Kiryu, a higher-ranked researcher. O5 Command has its eye fixed on Zyn Kiryu for unknown reasons, having dismissed her higher-ranked brother as ultimately irrelevant. She is being watched and investigated by the Red Right Hand -- whether positively or negatively is unknown.

[[/collapsible]]

----

**Dr. Adam Leeward:** [[[baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi|Emotionally confused]]] and [[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love| ethically conflicted]]] humanoid containment specialist from Site-11, living in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81| Site-81]]]. May or may not have made a few mistakes, may or may not have cleaned up a few mistakes. Not without the standard degree of coldness in personality traits, but with a few (sometimes painful) soft spots.

[[collapsible show="There's something off about you, Lee." hide="- Of course, there always was."]]

Under watch for abnormal behavior. Well-intentioned, but not without flaws. Of course, in this field, flaws like these can get you in deeper than you ever [[[scp-2708| expected.]]]

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-light Dr. Sophia Light]:** Biologist, surgeon and Site Director with far, far too many secrets. A likeable yet frightening person. Blunt, determined, calculating; good under pressure. Putting effort into remaining friendly and open (and emotionally stable). Bears minor facial scarring, and an old injury in her left hand sometimes impairs its functionality. Somewhat traumatic childhood; caretakers forced her to learn outdoor survival by leaving her stranded in the African wilderness for days on end. Joined the Foundation after a classified anomalous incident that killed eleven people, including her then-fiancee. Currently or formerly romantically linked with Troy Lament.

[[collapsible show="It's not my fault they want another meeting." hide="..."]]

The rumors that persist of Dr. Light's [[[deals-with-the-devil| strangely close involvement]]] with O5 Command (especially O5-2) are accurate, although that doesn't mean they make life easy for her - she's [[[resurrection| currently]]] head of the (possibly doomed) anomalous Task Force [[[task-forces#alpha-9| Alpha-9]]]. Seems to have been [[[annon| involved in]]] a number of [[[recovered-data-file| highly classified]]] reality shifts -- including some [[[yesterday| initiated by]]] the Foundation itself. A centrally important figure to the Foundation for a number of extremely secret reasons, some of which she doesn't know (or doesn't remember).

[[/collapsible]]

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-lillihammer Dr. Lillian S. Lillihammer]:** Genius-level intellect. Master memeticist of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43| Site-43]]]: discoverer, interpreter, [[[scp-5524|neutralizer]]] and [[[scp-5956|creator]]]. Always [[[meanwhile-in-australia|half a dozen steps ahead]]] of everyone else. Lead researcher on [[[vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub|Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]. Antisocial and arrogant, but so incredibly competent that nobody begrudges it.

[[collapsible show="I couldn't explain it to you if I wanted." hide="Not that I'd ever want."]]
Dr. Lillihammer has saved all of baseline reality from total destruction for [[[scp-5243| eighteen years and counting]]] without a single visible scar to show for it. The Foundation didn't find her, [[[dissertation| she found them]]], and they've never yet had cause to regret that fact. She is a lifelong friend of fellow Site-43 veteran Dr. Blank, and [[[scp-6056| romantically linked]]] with pataphysics whiz Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate. She gives them occasional cause to regret those facts.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/judith-low Dr. Judith Low]**: [[[sarkic-case-study-01-the-vas-n-a-of-sarvi| Senior Advisor]]] at the [[[an-anthropological-approach-to-sarkicism-case-study-02-the-d| Department of History]]]. [[[killing-in-the-name-of| Specialises]]] in the religious practices known as [[[sarkicism-hub| Sarkicism]]], and involved in the containment of [[[SCP-2133]]], [[[SCP-2191]]] and [[[SCP-2480]]].

----

**Dr. Connor MacWarren:** Active researcher focusing on the development of anomalous technologies on top of being one of the board of directors at [[[a-working-theory|Site-98]]] in Philadelphia. [[[SCP-4366|Currently oversees his own department]]] specializing in [[[SCP-5800|extradimensional anomalies]]]. Humble, sarcastic, irritable, and absolutely loathes having to repeat himself every time anyone mishears his dry jokes. Former member of the Marine Corps. with a highly-prolific GOC agent for a father, now estranged.

[[collapsible show="Hear me out: We make this huge sword..." hide="Yes, it is for research purposes."]]

Has had a history of exploiting the Foundation's resources to fuel his own personal projects. Dr. MacWarren claims that these are "very important experiments", when in reality, it is merely an excuse to develop superfluous weaponry and other devices. Despite his questionable work ethic, he is kept around due to his ingenuity and brilliance in the development of the Foundation's foothold of occult technologies and sciences.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-mann Dr. Everett Mann]:** [[[the-hatbot-chronicles| Unconventional]]] medical researcher with few scruples and a specialty in unusual forms of surgery. Jokingly referred to as a "mad scientist". (He objects to the term "mad scientist", claiming that "mad doctor" would be more accurate, and further that the difference should be plain to anyone with a proper academic background to speak of.) Willing to do [[[the-gate-opens| monstrous things]]] in the name of research. Possesses a dramatic moustache. Due to his [[[scp-6999| upbringing]]], his cultural and popular knowledges are [[[Be a Dali and Help a Mann Out, or The Lamentable State of Modern Art| woefully out of date]]], leading to anachronistic and ridiculous situations.

[[collapsible show="Yes, I wanted to show you what I've been working on." hide="It's dreadfully fascinating."]]

Came to Foundation attention via the uncle who raised him, a person of interest to the Foundation due to anomalous research. In close contact with [[[conviction| some]]] of the [[[scp-001-o5| most]]] senior [[[rounderhouse-proposal| people]]] in the Foundation. Considered a potential danger to the Foundation under [[[ecceperago| certain]]] predicted future [[[scp-5555| circumstances]]].

**Dr. Jaime Marlowe:** Average researcher, specializing in [[[SCP-2021| space-time]]], [[[SCP-2093| extra-dimensional]]], [[[SCP-922| visual, spatial]]], and [[[SCP-2981| cognitohazardous]]] anomalies. Previously described as "painfully, painfully, painfully average", notable more for minor interpersonal incidents and inappropriate outbursts when under stress. Marlowe's profile has slightly increased due to apparent [[[scp-2084-email-correspondence| unexplained connections]]] to unrelated anomalous events which only appear to have [[[SCP-1934| increased]]] in frequency.

----

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-mcdoctorate Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate]:** Head of the [[[scp-4410| 'Pataphysics Department]]]. Initially hired by the I.T. department, promoted to Department Head in 1996 for notable performance in the containment of [[[SCP-5241]]]. Promoted to Site Director, then personally requested reassignment to the 'Pataphysics Department. Promoted to Department Head for notable developments in Theoretical 'Pataphysics, then [[[placeholder| founded]]] the Archetypicals Division. At some point, had [[[whack-a-mole|his name]]] retroactively abstracted by [[[scp-5242|SCP-INTEGER]]].

**[/system:page-tags/tag/riven-mercer Dr. Riven Mercer]:** Veterinary-focused researcher, second-in-command of [[[kiryu labs hub | Kiryu Labs]]]. Handles personnel allocation for incoming [[[reality check | anomalous item]]] caches, often goes on [[[remember you | outside assignments]]]. Good with animals, owns a grumpy bearded dragon lizard who lives in the lab.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-reynders Dr. Ilse Reynders]:** Non-victim of [[[SCP-5616|a disaster]]] which trapped her in what should have been stasis, which she instead turned into an eight-decade self-improvement course. Now possesses sixteen doctorates, the sharpest mind at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 | Site-43]]] and an unaging brain and body. An early and modern pioneer of [[[Acroamatic Abatement]]], and potentially [[[SCP-5956 | future Director]]] [[[SCP-6327 | of the Temporal Anomalies Department]]], she was also part of the team which developed the Foundation's [[[pickman-blank-proposal | Frontispiece glamour]]] to disguise its various front companies.

Ilse Reynders should have been Director of Site-43 some day. She was there at the moment of its conception, and only an accident in the Anomalous Documents Disposal Chamber robbed her of a promising lifelong career. Through dint of extraordinary mental and emotional fortitude, she instead spent multiple lifetimes behind glass with the sole aim of becoming the Foundation's foremost expert in [[[SCP-6984 | almost everything]]], before escaping almost as a matter of course. She's outlived everyone she ever loved, and she's gone from living in an incinerator to [[[SCP-6500 | thinking outside the box]]] -- and to someone as clever as Ilse, [[[CAST | even time is just another box]]].

Dr. Sinclair performed her first spell at the age of 17, accidentally setting fire to her notebook by drawing a Hermetic Circle and infusing it with some latent magical talent she possessed. In college, she got involved with a more violent sect of the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub| Serpent's Hand]]], and after seeing they were willing to sacrifice humans -- which could lead to very violent thaumaturgical consequences -- she practically ran to the Foundation. Any rumors about her hobbies and personal life are lies and slander.

**Director Cody Westbrook:** The former protege of Julian Corwin, Cody Westbrook was directly recruited through the Foundation Service Academy, graduating fourth in his class at Cheyenne Point. After service with MTF Omega-17 ("Florida Men") and MTF Sigma-23 ("Wily Coyotes"), he was assigned as the handler for Special Asset [[[florence-thorne-hub|Agent Firestarter]]] and given command of MTF Delta-3 ("Solomon's Hand"), becoming one of the youngest MTF commanders at the time. He compiled an exemplary service record with Delta-3, until its dissolution following the loss of Agent Firestarter. An internal inquiry board chaired by Analytics Director Simon Pietrykau assigned no fault to Agent Westbrook, but the incident marred his reputation.

After Delta-3 was dissolved, Westbrook was promoted to Site Director of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-246|Site-246]]] to fill the vacancy left by Director Corwin's transfer to Site-64. He has served in that role ever since.

**O5 Command:** 13 people who have ultimate control over the Foundation. Unusual personalities with way too much power. They do not and cannot come into contact with any anomalous entities. Mostly everyone is afraid of them. They know absolutely everything there is to know about the Foundation and its activities. They rarely intervene in the containment of SCPs... except when they do. They have their own Mobile Task Force, [[[task-forces#alpha-1| Alpha-1]]], the "Red Right Hand". O5 Command are the masters of the Foundation, and not everyone knows they exist.

[[collapsible show="Nothing is certain." hide="Especially not us. God no."]]

... //Maybe.// Maybe there are 13, maybe they are people. They're not //supposed// to come into contact with anomalous entities, but in secret, sometimes they do. Who are they? Where did they come from? What secret goals are they striving towards? Either way, O5 Command is the cornerstone of the Foundation. At the very least, they have the Foundation's best interests at heart... Maybe.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/the-administrator "The Administrator"]:** Figure of little-known nature playing a role best understood by O5 Command. Possibly anomalous, possibly multiple people. Once represented the Foundation in meetings with major world government figures; has since relinquished this role. Possibly retired, possibly deceased.

[[collapsible show="Why?" hide="Maybe you're asking the wrong questions."]]

It's an open secret amongst the upper echelons of the Foundation that "The Administrator" (as popularly known) never at any point existed, but was a clever fiction created by another person or persons (or... something else) within the Foundation for the purposes of unifying of a fractious organization. As for what should be made of that, no one agrees.

**[/system:page-tags/tag/general-bowe General Bowe]:** More than anyone, the man who represents the old sins of the Foundation. Promoted after the death of his father, General Stan Bowe, due to the effects of [[[SCP-935]]]. As his father's protege, he was assigned as the head of the Bowe Commission, which began for murky still-classified reasons and expanded in scope under the younger Bowe, ending with a nearly sole focus on weaponizing SCP objects before its dissolution. Has since left the Foundation.

[[collapsible show="ACCesDend" hide="dsdffdsfvd"]]
Under the younger Bowe, the Bowe Commission shifted the Foundation's paramilitary focus from defense to offense. The Bowe Commission was responsible for the creation of "Project Able" and Mobile Task Force [[[task-forces#omega-7| Omega-7]]] ("Pandora's Box"), given permission for the project after a number of successful operations against several dangerous groups of interest. Bowe was personally responsible for much of the worst excesses of the project; he allowed [[[SCP-076| SCP-076-2]]] to take a leadership role and have say in which SCP items were allowed to join, and he personally ordered the project to continue after an incident in which 076-2 killed a number of researchers. When 076-2 disabled its restraints and slaughtered most of the other Mobile Task Force members and caused the destruction of Containment Area-25, Bowe was assigned primary blame. MTF Omega-7 was dissolved, as was the Bowe Commission. As a result of this, and the [[[SCP-935]]] incidents, much of the Foundation's paramilitary arm was censured or defected after this, and many of the Bowe Commission's supporters defected to the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]] or the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]].

Bowe was presumed deceased, but [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub| more recent evidence]]] suggests that he's still alive, and isn't finished with the Foundation yet.

Assigned the codename "FIRESTARTER", Agent Elsinger served as a battlemage with Mobile Task Force Delta-3 ("Solomon's Hand"), based out of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-246|Site-246]]] under Lake Superior. Agent Elsinger and Delta-3 served as the pilot project for the SATF Program, proving the viability of the concept and paving the way for further recruitment of thaumaturges and thaumatologists by the Foundation.

[[collapsible show="She is believed to have died in a thaumaturgy accident in 1990." hide="She's not dead and it wasn't an accident."]]

In 1990, Agent Elsinger [[[thorne-is-born|faked her death]]] with the assistance of the Unusual Incidents Unit, changing her name to Florence Thorne and later [[[when-parallel-lines-diverge|joining the Unit]]] as a Special Agent operating out of [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]]. Special Agent Thorne contributed significantly to the UIU's own parastrike programs, spearheading the formation of the Mobile Occult Operations Team, a fast-deployment crisis-response unit for major parathreats, and serving as its first commander. She eventually rose to the position of Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the UIU's Three Portlands field office, where she pushed for strict enforcement of the Hoover Mandate and other hardline anti-Foundation policies, which won her prominence and popularity among the city's citizens. [[[unusual-investigations|According to UIU files]]], she was killed in action during operations against the Lighthouse Mafia in 2008.

Driven by an intense omnicidal rage and hatred for all life, its containment breaches have cost the Foundation an incalculable amount of resources and personnel.

The Reptile's imprisonment by the Foundation has brought it into contact with multiple other SCP objects, including [[[SCP-076]]] [[[the-warrior-and-the-dragon|"Able"]]], [[[scp-079| SCP-079 "Old AI"]]], and [[[scp-999| SCP-999 "The Tickle Monster"]]].

Alexei is believed to be of extra-universal origin, and claims to have a [[[War is Child's Play| military background]]] despite a general [[[scp-2273-f| aversion to violence]]]. However, if his claims of combat experience and memory retention are to be believed, it is likely that Alexei Belitrov remains capable of acts of armed violence.

Additionally, in Reality Construct FZ27GO, [[[Heroic Spirit Alexei Belitrov| multiple persons resembling Alexei Belitrov]]] spontaneously manifested, and were frequently sighted fighting at nighttime. In most occasions, these iterations of Alexei Belitrov are accompanied by a unidentified human with a red tattoo on one of their hands.

[[[icky-the-magic-clown| Icky the Magic Clown]]] is believed to be one of many [[[icky-ichabod| ontokinetic humanoids]]] employed by the Circus as [[[clown-town| Clowns]]], though investigations have led the Foundation to believe she was originally a [[[herman-fuller-can-shove-it-up-his-ass| non-anomalous human]]] known as Veronica Mason.

"He" may be fictional, but a code-word used by Hand members to identify friendlies, standing for "Lease Signatory". If not fictional, certainly under the effects of [[[SCP-268]]].

**Mr. Marshall, Mr. Carter, and [[[poi-dark| Mr. Dark]]]:** The [[[acquisitions1| leaders]]] and [[[from-vagrants-to-gentlemen| founders]]] of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter and Dark]]], an organization selling anomalous items to the rich and powerful. Information on the upper management of this group is limited and often inconsistent, possibly because [[[third-death| several generations]]] of the same [[[scp-4566| families]]] are involved, including the Person of Interest known as **[/system:page-tags/tag/iris-dark Ms. Iris Dark]**.

[[collapsible show="The esteemed Misters Marshall, Carter..." hide="... and Dark."]]

[[[acquisitions2| Reports]]] on Marshall and Carter have been wildly inconsistent. A [[[mc-d-agent-orientation| number of reports]]] characterize Carter as wheelchair-bound, presenting Marshall as younger; these reports are contradicted by [[[acquisitions3| other sources]]] saying exactly the opposite. Reports on Carter that claim he is wheelchair-bound also claim he is using anomalous life extension, apparently feeding off a bagged and drugged (but still aware) human attached to the back of his wheelchair. Additional [[[third-death| rumors]]] assert that "Amos" Marshal feeds on human souls, while "Ruprecht" Carter is able to transfer his consciousness between bodies.

The appearance and nature of [[[poi-dark| Dark]]] is even more speculative, but reports on Dark (alternatively spelled [[[a-darke-tale-new-age|Darke]]]) fall into three categories. The first category presents Dark as being a role [[[when-situations-degenerate| filled by multiple people]]] (most often male) over the last few centuries. The second category presents Dark as a single semi-immortal sapient entity, humanoid in nature if not always in form, possibly able to change bodies and gender to suit current purposes. A third category presents [[[so they called him darke| both as true]]], with a much older "Percival" Darke coexisting with a younger "proxy" (perhaps the [[[dark-and-disquieting| latest]]] of [[[the-boy-who-cried-wolf| many]]]).

It seems that Marshall and Carter do not fully understand Dark either. While they handle most operations, Dark has more control over MC&D than they do, and [[[a-question-of-commerce| predates]]] Marshall and Carter [[[scp-3549| significantly]]]. Curiously, it seems that Dark may be less malevolent than MC&D itself — whoever they are, their morality seems highly situational, though they are capable of [[[scp-5802| monstrous acts]]] above and beyond the capabilities of their organization.

[[[wills-and-ways-hub| Some]]] [[[all-that-glisters| accounts]]] of MC&D describe "Junior Partners", descendants of the "Senior Partners" described above. These include adventurer and explorer [[[skitter-marshall| Skitter Marshal]]], hedonistic playboy [[[robert-carter| Robert Carter]]], and technological prodigy [[[iris-dark| Iris Dark]]], [[[micky-d-s| Chief]]] of [[[the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6| Paratech]]] [[[mcd-smart-hex| Development]]] and [[[osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1| Acquisition]]].

[[collapsible show="Nobody knows." hide="Nobody's here."]]

No one in the Foundation seems to know if Nobody is working [[[killing-knowledge| for or against]]] the Foundation; if reports are to be believed, the answer is "both".

**[/system:page-tags/tag/kenneth-spencer Kenneth Spencer] and [/system:page-tags/tag/robin-thorne Robin Thorne]:** A pair of UIU agents assigned to [[[three-portlands-hub| Three Portlands]]].

They have collaborated with the Foundation on [[[permanent-waves| several occasions]]], including playing an instrumental role in the joint [[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon| Foundation/UIU raid]]] of [[[anderson-robotics-hub| Anderson Robotics]]] World Headquarters. Additionally, both agents are members of Joint Task Force Delta-3 ("Organic Free Trade"), with Agent Spencer assuming command of the task force during operations in Three Portlands.
 
Agent Thorne is a natural thaumaturge of moderate ability with extensive occult training; Agent Spencer is believed to be non-anomalous, but has significant experience in paranormal affairs. Both agents make extensive use of paratechnology and occult devices in the field, employing a number of custom items in addition to their standard issue UIU equipment. They should both be considered roughly equal to a Foundation agent in terms of capability and effectiveness.

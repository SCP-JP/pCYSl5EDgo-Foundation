> 
> **Ashcombe:** All right, let's get this fucking thing over with. 
> 
> **Dalton:** The old man's right. I can't take much more of this. But before you all vote for me, I just want to say—
> 
> **Simmons:** We're not voting for you, moron. 
> 
> **Dalton:** What? Really? Nobody?
> 
> **Ashcombe:** Fuck you! I'm voting for him!
> 
> **Long:** I'm not. I'm voting for Jeannie.
> 
> **Kirkwood:** Love you too, Shells.
> 
> **Simmons:** People, please. Nobody's voting for anyone yet. I have something to say. 
> 
> **Hughes:** You usually do, yeah.
> 
> **Simmons:** We've tried a lot of things. We've tried ending the vote in a tie. We've tried not voting at all. But in forty-five years, there's still something we haven't tried. I don't know if it's part of the magic or if we're all just stupid— 
> 
> **Ashcombe:** If you've got a plan, give it to us sometime //today//, please. 
> 
> **Simmons:** Ricks. We need to vote for Dr. Ricks. 
> 
> [11 seconds silence]
> 
> **Hughes:** Jesus christ.
> 
> **Ashcombe:** Sure. Worth a shot.
> 
> **Dalton:** Wait. Wait. I don't understand.
> 
> **Simmons:** Think about it. We've suspected for years that the game was rigged. 
> 
> //Dr. Ricks, observing the proceedings from the nearby, becomes visibly agitated.//
> 
> **Research Assistant Baxter:** (//To Dr. Ricks//) Should we intervene?
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** Let's wait a moment.
> 
> **Simmons:** This whole thing is an obvious act of sadism. Something is toying with us. Naturally, then, it would want to watch us. 
> 
> **Dalton:** Dr. Ricks has only been around for, what? Eight years?
> 
> **Hughes:** We've had other presiding researchers before him. Dr. Olsen, Dr. Smith, Dr. Shipley—
> 
> **Long:** It could all be the same person! It's changing its shape!
> 
> **Simmons:** Exactly. 
> 
> **Kirkwood:** Son of a bitch.
> 
> **Hughes:** Wait, I thought you said you knew?
> 
> **Kirkwood:** I lied.
> 
> **Simmons:** So it's settled: we're voting for Ricks. Any objections?
> 
> //Other subjects express agreement.//
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** I'm sorry, I'm afraid that involving any person other than SCP-3306 persons of interest would be considered a breach of containment. 
> 
> **Kirkwood:** Go to hell!
> 
> **Hughes:** I can't believe we trusted you.
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** (//To Research Assistant Baxter//) Issue a lockdown.
> 
> //Baxter does not respond.//
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** Put us on lockdown, damn it!
> 
> **Research Assistant Baxter:** I'm sorry, I don't... When did you start working here? I'm trying to remember, and I—
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** Keep your head. It's memetic! It's affecting your mind! Just issue the lockdown and we can discuss this later.
> 
> **Research Assistant Baxter:** Why don't //you// issue it, sir? You have clearance, don't you? 
> 
> //Dr. Ricks violently grabs Baxter by the throat.//
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** I am a Foundation scientist! I was always a scientist! I didn't want any of this! You think I //liked this?// Fuck you, you don't even—
> 
> //SCP-3306 abruptly stops turning, causing 3306-POI subjects fall over.//
> 
> **SCP-3306:** (//Prerecorded message//) Congratulations, you win! We hope you enjoyed the game. Play again soon!
> 
> //Dr. Ricks releases Research Assistant Baxter, who quickly flees. The lights on SCP-3306 go dark. Dr. Ricks collapses.//
> 
> **Dr. Ricks:** I see. Thank you for your time.

**Afterword:** Following this event, SCP-3306 ceased all anomalous activity and 3306-POI subjects were placed under quarantine. Subsequent autopsy of Dr. Rick's body shows that he suffered a fatal heart attack at the time SCP-3306 deactivated. No other anomalous features of the body were observed, and investigators have yet to confirm any abnormalities in Dr. Rick's history with the Foundation. 3306-POI subjects appear to have regained normal biological functions. 

By order of Site Director Goode, if no other anomalous phenomena are observed within a period of 370 days, SCP-3306 is to be reclassified as Neutralized and its documentation rewritten. Once neutralization is confirmed, 3306-POI are to be administered amnestics, assigned new identities, and reintegrated into society.

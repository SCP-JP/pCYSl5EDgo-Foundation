When asked for comment, the Second Wandsman of Earth replied that the search for the missing cartographer would continue, but there were limited leads to follow up on. "As of right now we are asking any and all members of the organization to come forward if they have any information that could direct us to his whereabouts."

[[tab ~Code of Conduct~]]
It is best to think of these as... Guidelines more than rules. You should follow them 99% of the time, but we will need myriad different perspectives in order to find the truth and I don't want to quash yours with hard and fast rules.
-----
That said, if you deviate from the code too much, you're definitely going to end up getting questioned by your colleagues, perhaps even the editors if you've truly drifted too far.
-----
**1) Preserve as much knowledge as possible**
If you have the opportunity to learn something, take it. And make sure to record it as well.

**2) Spread knowledge as much as possible**
If you have the opportunity to teach someone else something, take it. Be aware that educating an unwilling mind is an extremely difficult task, so gaining the trust of those around you is quite important here.

I should note, you are not obligated to teach an intensive seminar on how to make nuclear weapons to toddlers. Make the information available, but be prudent. We've had [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5687 enough fiascos].

**3) There is no such thing as "bad" knowledge, merely knowledge we have not found a way to comprehend yet**
You will learn many horrible things working for our organization. You will even encounter knowledge that seems to possess its own will and a desire to harm you. Contain these things if you can. We [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ have acquaintances] that can help with that.

**4) Treat other perspectives with respect, especially when you disagree with them**
Note, if the perspective is "I want to have you for lunch" you don't have to immediately let a creature devour you out of respect. Rather, try to understand why the creature wants your flesh. Perhaps you can provide it with an alternative. Perhaps then you can get its story.

**5) Destroy knowledge as little as possible**
This can be more difficult than it first seems, and honestly it seems quite difficult. Books and minds and concepts can all seek to harm you and everything you love. We know sometimes you will have to destroy them to preserve other knowledge, but try to do this as a last resort.

**6) Be careful in Red Zones**
A "Red Zone" is a place known to be ruled by a greater entity, such as [[[scp-2264|Alagadda]]] or [[[larue-hub|La Rue Macabre]]] (although the greater being ruling the latter is much more amicable). These places require some clever negotiations to enter at best and can be instantly fatal upon entry at worst. As much as I love my dear Ickis, working the Red Zone beat has made him a fascinating combination of paranoid, over-prepared and insane. Frankly that's the most rational way to be if you want to explore some of the multiverse's more terrible places.

**7) Don't think you're alone**
Look... I know it sounds flippant, saying that we Wandsmen are family, but we genuinely are a team, and all of us have suffered to become part of it. When you burn out researching a story, ask for help. And help your colleagues whenever you can. Further still, help other thinking beings if you can so long as you're not helping them on a path of destruction. Accept help from them too.

You aren't alone in this.

[[tab ~Article Formatting~]]
Writing Periodicals for us can be a somewhat loose experience. The **//Wandsman's Gazette//** is a collected publication of all of our recent works and the only hard and fast formatting rule required by the editors for otherwise uncategorized articles is that the following be  placed at the bottom: 

[[div style="display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#000000 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px"]]

//Originally published in the Wandsmen's Gazette on [DATE]//
 [[footnote]] The date is to be localized to appear as the standard date format for the reader's location and must change based on that location. The runes to do this are available in the "formatting" section of the back issues archive, along with the runes for local translation to the reader's preferred language. Ask for the 23rd Wandsperson of Leothin, they'll sort you right out. [[/footnote]]

[[/div]]

But there are some more popular recurring articles that have specific formatting needs.

Starting with Lighter Fare, **//Game On!//** is an excellent column written by the 15th Wandsman of Pasia (with guest contributors showing up from time to time). Here he reviews the latest interactive experiences in the multiverse.

//Originally published in the Wandsmen's Gazette on [DATE]//

[[/div]]


A more personal interest oriented column is **//Traveling the Ways with Allora-7//**.

Obviously, the Seventh Wandsman of Allora is the primary contributor for this series of articles exploring the daily lives of the inhabitants of the lesser-known cracks of the multiverse, but he has been known to accept thoughtful articles from other contributors.

> **__What's all this about?__**
> 
> The Wandsmen are a GoI focused on reporting on anomalous events and preserving knowledge. They have joined the fight to defend the multiverse from destruction largely because of their desire to preserve knowledge.
> 
> The Wandsmen are very flexible to write for. Their morality is generally decent, but it can be very alien (imagine preserving knowledge by turning someone into a brain in a jar. Some Wandsmen would think this was terrible, but many of the more alien Wandsmen just "Wouldn't think this was the best method because it restricts those minds from experiencing new things and gaining more interesting information." It certainly wouldn't be seen as an inherently evil act by the Wandsmen at large).
> 
> Currently the organization in general is trying to befriend the Foundation as they see them as potential allies in the fight to avoid all their books getting burned, but there's a lot of tension around this because a lot of Wandsmen also want to write about Earth's stories and distribute their magazines.
> 
> In short, there is some inherent diplomatic conflict in the setting.
> 
> Another important thing to note is that the members of the Wandsmen are most often survivors or refugees from horrible anomalous tragedies that occurred on their planets of origin, or nightmares that ravaged the alternate realities they once called home. They seek to write about the universe so what happened to them is not forgotten, and hopefully learned from.
> 
> If you have any questions about the GoI and writing for it. please reach out to  [[*user chaucer345]] for details!

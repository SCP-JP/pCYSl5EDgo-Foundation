**Special Containment Procedures:** Personnel are to work with the JMSDF[[footnote]]The Kaijō Jieitai, or Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.[[/footnote]] and other naval and aeronautic authorities to enforce a twenty-five kilometer exclusion zone around SCP-4182. All entrances and windows that provide access to SCP-4182's interior have been welded shut via steel-reinforced acrylic paneling coated in a graded-Z laminate. Access is strictly prohibited.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SILVER) is to review IntSCPFN servers for files affected by SCP-4182. These files are to be isolated and reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5.

**Description:** SCP-4182 is a 6.4-hectare (16-acre) artificial island located 75 kilometers south of Ipponsugi, Japan. Although no record of its construction exists, its configuration suggests it was built as a waste containment facility at some point in the early 20th century. 

Foundation documents will periodically identify SCP-4182 as a non-existent site ("Site-5"). The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood. 

Several of SCP-4182's (now sealed) structures contained stairwells plugged with concrete. Excavations of these stairwells led to the discovery of a massive subterranean complex located beneath SCP-4182 containing a ████ ██ █████ ███████. No further excavations are to be made. 

Since its discovery in 2001, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been increasing significantly.

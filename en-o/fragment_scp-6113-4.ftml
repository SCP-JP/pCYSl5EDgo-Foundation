**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6113-3 has escaped containment, assisted by SCP-6113-1 and presumably Dr. James Park[[footnote]]See Addendum 6113-3.20: Containment Breach 6113-3 15/11/2019.[[/footnote]]. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") is to locate SCP-6113-3 and bring her into containment where she will be held until the age of 18 in 2025. If such a time passes without recontainment, she is instead to be located and given Class C and G amnestics. Dr. James Park is to be terminated as soon as possible.

Amnesticization and planting of false memories in SCP-6113-3 to remove any knowledge of Dr. James Park pending Ethics Committee approval.

As of writing, SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park have not been located.

[[div class="blockquote"]]
= **Containment Breach Report**
-----
**Date:** 15/11/2019
**Site:** 17
**SCP(s) Involved:** SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3
**MTF(s) Involved:** Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders")
**Personnel Involved:** Various Site-17 security personnel, Dr. Brandon Fisher
**Other(s) Involved:** Dr. James Park (presumably)
----
On 15/11/2019, at 10:26 PM, SCP-6113-1 appeared unnoticed in an unpopulated portion of Site-17, disguised as Site Director Thomas Graham. SCP-6113-1 made its way to Dr. Brandon Fisher's office, mimicing his behavior perfectly so as to remain undetected.

Still disguised, SCP-6113-1 then requested Dr. Fisher's Level 3 Access Card for "security purposes." Despite the suspect reasoning, Dr. Fisher granted SCP-6113-1 his Access Card before returning to his terminal. SCP-6113-1 then left Dr. Fisher's office and walked towards the Low-Security Humanoid Containment wing. When alone, SCP-6113-1 took the opportunity to disguise as Dr. Fisher. This was captured on surveillance cameras, and security personnel were alerted.

At 11:03 PM, a full site lockdown was ordered by Site Director Graham. Mobile Task Force Lambda-69 ("Six-Color Crusaders") was deployed, with an ETA of approximately 10 minutes. SCP-6113-1, still disguised, arrived in the humanoid containment wing and requested to meet with SCP-6113-3. Approximately half of the guards stationed in this wing were absent, attending to the lockdown order. Again, despite the suspicious circumstances, the guard allowed SCP-6113-1 into SCP-6113-3's containment cell. This was captured on surveillance cameras.

Upon entrance, SCP-6113-3 reacted with alarm and anger, shouting several expletives. SCP-6113-1 then disappeared for a few moments before returning with a woman, presumably Dr. James Park. SCP-6113-3 was shocked, yet calmed immediately. The following exchange is logged below:

[[div class="blockquote"]]
**SCP-6113-3:** James...?

**Dr. Park:** It's... Janet now.

**SCP-6113-3:** Holy fucking shit, your egg cracked!

**Dr. Park:** No thanks to you. <smiles>

= //<SCP-6113-3 runs up and hugs Dr. Park.>//

**SCP-6113-3:** I missed you so much, dickhead.

= //<Dr. Park hugs her tightly.>//

**Dr. Park:** I missed you, too... dipshit.

**SCP-6113-3:** Ha! Finally got you to curse at me!

= //<Dr. Park giggles.>//

**SCP-6113-3:** So, what's the plan?

**Dr. Park:** We break out with -2's help.

**SCP-6113-3:** Then?

**Dr. Park:** ...For once in my life, I've got nothing planned after that.

= //<SCP-6113-3 grabs Dr. Park's hand.>//

**SCP-6113-3:** Well, lead the way.
[[/div]]

SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park both left two documents and three labeled photos on the containment cell's desk. The group left the containment cell as security personnel approached their position. SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park then sprinted in the opposite direction.

At 11:12 PM, MTF Lambda-69 arrived in the humanoid containment wing, in front of the group. MTF Lambda-69 engaged the group, firing non-lethal ammunition. All projectiles, however, harmlessly collided with their bodies. SCP-6113-3 and Dr. James Park exhibited no pain response. One member of MTF Lambda-69 then vocalized several thaumaturgical incantations in an attempt to disable SCP-6113-1's known abilities. These incantations were only successful in removing SCP-6113-1's ability to disguise, revealing its true orange light form. With SCP-6113-1's assistance, the group disappeared from view.

At 11:15 PM, Site-17's lockdown order was lifted, and search efforts for SCP-6113-1, SCP-6113-3, and Dr. James Park were initiated for all Foundation agents and applicable Mobile Task Forces within a 100 km radius. At 4:00 AM, the search order was lifted.

I am thankful for my time with the Foundation, and I have enjoyed working on the SCP-6113 project immensely. However, I cannot, in good conscience, continue my employment. The reason: SCP-6113-3. It was envy, she said. That the idea of being a girl for her was more desirable than actually being a boy. I didn't understand it at the time. Needless to say, my desire to be her mother shadowed my judgement. For the better.
@@ @@
I know I've been compromised. You will search for and attempt to terminate me. For once, I don't care. I love her and I will do anything to protect her. That includes what I've just done. Forgive me, but I did what I thought was necessary. What I thought was "ethical."

I expect to see you soon. And, again, thank you, truly, for the opportunity.

Dear Foundation,

Dare I say it, but maybe taking a little abused trans girl hostage wasn't the best decision you've ever made. Sure, life could've been worse for me, but it could've also been better. Who knows? You never even gave me the chance. I know one thing for certain, though. I never had a family and the Foundation couldn't give me one. Wouldn't even let me have one. So I had to find my own. Janet.

Don't try looking for me and her. Ya'll may be all powerful, but I have an invincible spirit thing protecting me. And, don't you dare touch Alena again. Or I swear to god, I'll make ya'll bleed.

There isn't much more for me to say other than that. Of course, with love, fuck you.

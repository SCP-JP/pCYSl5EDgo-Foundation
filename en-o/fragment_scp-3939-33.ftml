[[div class="story"]]
Three days is a lot of time. All bragging aside, you've done this //many// times. Enough to know exactly what you're doing, and enough to know that it won't take you three whole days just to draft a single set of SCPs.

After all, whatever it is, it's been sat in storage for god knows how many years. Without incident. At least, without documented incident. This thing is as Safe as it gets. You'll be fine.

You've had a stressful week. You deserve an early night. SCP-3939 has waited this long â€” one more day can't hurt.

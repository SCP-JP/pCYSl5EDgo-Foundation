**Item #:** SCP-5148

**Object Class:** Malchut 

**Special Containment Procedures:** Procedure 5148-Alpha is to be observed when referring to ##blue|**the object class between Chokhmah and Binah**## for all anomalies registered in the Site-19 SCiPnet database. The object class may be spoken aloud, but not typed into the SCiPnet database to prevent the effects of SCP-5148 from manifesting. 

Due to the nature of SCP-5148, the anomaly itself and any SCP objects of the same object class are not to be tagged as **##blue|the topmost of the Sephirot##**, and are instead designated as Malchut. Use of object class **##blue|the most hidden of things##** is still to be utilized in standard Foundation databases outside of Site-19.


**Description:** SCP-5148 is a digital anomaly affecting the Site-19 SCiPnet database. When an SCP object is tagged and designated as **##blue|the coronal object class##**, SCP-5148 will manifest and change all uses of the word to 'Peter', as well as replace any attached image files with crudely drawn images of a character wearing green pants and a white button-up shirt. 

SCP-5148 was originally discovered by Alexandra.aic when the construct detected multiple unauthorized edits on hundreds of SCP files hosted on the Site-19 SCiPnet database. Alexandra.aic initially attempted to revert edits on the affected articles, but was unable to do so and alerted Foundation personnel to the problem. To date, all attempts to train AIC to edit files affected by SCP-5148 have failed.

**Addendum 5148.01:** Recovered Chat Logs
The following chat logs were found in an abandoned GoI-5869 'Gamers Against Weed' chatroom by a Foundation webcrawler and are believed to be relevant to SCP-5148. The document has been edited to follow Procedure 5148-Alpha.

> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** check your PMs
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** I have an idea to fuck with them based on what you told us.
> **##pink|bluntfiend:##** You need to be careful with whatever you're doing. The Foundation are no joke nad messing around with them could lead to a lot of bad shit for us, especially if they find out we're directly fucking with them.
> **##pink|bluntfiend:##** *and
> **##pink|bluntfiend:##** **##red|gaycopmp4##** Promise you will be careful?
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** dont be such a worrywart, jude. things are different now.

> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** can you imagine all the bad press that would generate?
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** 'scp foundation hunts down gay shitposters'
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** there would be a media circus. the foundation can't do shit as long as people remember what happened to north korea.
> **##pink|bluntfiend:##** I guess you're right.
> **##pink|bluntfiend:##** But you can't blame me for, you know, caring about everyone here's safety.
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** of course not dude but
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** no ones going to get hurt from this stupid prank

> **##orange|jockjamsvol6:##** Any chance we can get a sneak peek at what you're doing?
> **##red|gaycopmp4:##** **##orange|jockjamsvol6##** let's just say we're lucky there's a family guy. ;)

> I've just checked the original correspondence. It's absolutely SCP-3939 that I've been assigned to. Both O5-3 and O5-9 have confirmed this over the course of several emails in the past week. There's no doubt that there's an SCP-3939 in pre-containment at Site-39 — or at least, the O5s have good reason to think so.
> 
> I'd much appreciate it if you could take another look to see if you can find anything. I can cc O5-3 and O5-9 if needed.

> Thanks,

> Researcher ████ ████████

You feel a bit shitty for name dropping the O5s — even though everything you've said is true. Maybe you should have just lied and said you made a mistake. Your risk pays off, though — it works. You get a response after no more than two minutes.

> ████,
> 
> No need to get the O5s involved — I'll look into this immediately.
> 
> It's unreasonable to expect you to make any headway on this without information. I'd suggest you go home, get a good night's sleep, and make a strong start on this with information that I find today rather than a weak one now.

> Sincerely,

> Site Director Amanda Salisbury

Overall, this is a good result. The best solution now would be to wait for more information. Make a strong start, as she puts it.

On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a weak start which becomes a strong not-start tomorrow. You still have time today — why waste it?
